## [1.9.8] — port-aware virtual hosts

### Added
- **Port-aware virtual hosts (`VHOST_PORT_AWARE`).** The vhost identity can now
  include the inbound `Host` **port**, so `challenges.site.com:8008` and
  `challenges.site.com:8009` are **distinct vhosts** — each with its own
  upstream, per-vhost policy, statistics, and ban scope. Default **off** (the
  port is stripped, host-only keying — the historical behaviour); opt-in and
  hot-reloadable via Controls / `POST /secured/config`.
  - **Why:** CTFd serves *dynamic challenges* as separate instances on the
    **same hostname but different ports**. Host-only keying collapsed every
    challenge into one vhost, making per-instance upstream/policy/ban-scope
    impossible — port-aware keying is required to front per-instance CTFd
    dynamic challenges from one gateway.
  - **Lookup precedence:** exact `host:port` → portless `host` (an all-ports
    fallback) → `*.parent[:port]` wildcards. A portless entry
    (`challenges.site.com`) catches any port without an exact `host:port` entry.
  - **Scope of change is small** — the vhost key is derived in one place
    (`vhost.set_vhost`) and consumed as an opaque string everywhere downstream
    (`events.vhost`, dashboards, per-vhost bans `ip_bans_vhost`, RPS windows),
    so they become port-distinct automatically with no schema change.
  - `_validate_vhost_hostname` accepts an optional `:PORT` (1-65535) suffix when
    the knob is on (the `VHOSTS` env, the Settings add form, and `/secured/vhosts`
    all accept `host:port`); rejects it otherwise.
  - **Deployment note:** the gateway binds a single `LISTEN_PORT` and tells the
    ports apart purely from the `Host` header — the front (CDN / reverse proxy)
    must forward the original `host:port` (or `X-Forwarded-Host`).
  - (`config.py` `VHOST_PORT_AWARE`, `vhost.py` `set_vhost`/`_resolve_vhost_entry`/
    `_validate_vhost_hostname`, `core/proxy_handler.py` `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS`.)

### Fixed
- **Default ports (`:80`/`:443`) are normalised to portless in port-aware mode.**
  Browsers and reverse proxies (incl. Cloudflare) send `Host: site.com` — no
  port — for default-port traffic, so a port-aware vhost keyed `site.com:443`
  previously never matched. `:80`/`:443` now collapse to portless at every
  key-forming site (`set_vhost`, env/file config load, `vhost_set`,
  `vhost_delete`), making `site.com`, `site.com:80` and `site.com:443` one vhost
  while non-default ports (e.g. `:8008`) stay distinct. (`vhost._strip_default_port`)

### Tests
- `tests/test_v198_vhost_port_aware.py` — 16 tests: default-off host-only
  behaviour, distinct `host:port` vhosts, portless all-ports fallback, exact
  `host:port` wins over portless, wildcard matching ±port, hostname validation
  (accept `:PORT` only when aware), `vhost_set` CRUD, and (iteration) the four
  default-port normalisation cases (`:80`/`:443` → portless on match/store/delete;
  `:8008` stays distinct). Added `VHOST_PORT_AWARE` to the `test_165` every-knob
  round-trip.

## [1.9.7] — 2026-06-23 — fast startup (deferred state rehydrate)

### Performance
- **Gateway accepts connections in ~3 s instead of ~60 s after a restart.** On a
  large Postgres deployment, `on_startup` blocked aiohttp from serving while it
  rehydrated dashboard state synchronously — measured on a 1.18M-request /
  19,469-client / 8M-event store: ~17 s of full-table aggregate scans in
  `db_load_state` plus a ~35 s **unbounded** `ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 250` across
  every chunk of the Timescale `events` hypertable. Because the server doesn't
  accept until `on_startup` returns, a Cloudflare-fronted origin returned a
  `502` for the whole window on every upgrade. The cosmetic rehydrate
  (`db_load_state` + `_rehydrate_timeline` + `_rehydrate_events`) now runs in a
  **background task after the server is accepting**, offloaded to a thread
  executor (`run_in_executor`) so the slow blocking DB reads never stall the
  event loop. Dashboards fill in within a few seconds of serving.
  (`proxy.py`, `db/sqlite.py`; `tests/test_v197_deferred_rehydrate.py`.)
- **Security path unaffected.** `_rehydrate_bans()` stays **synchronous** (runs
  before the server accepts) so a banned IP can never slip through the warm-up
  window. `db_load_state` gained a `clear_first` param: the deferred (merge)
  path calls it with `clear_first=False` so it never wipes `ip_state` or
  downgrades an already-active in-memory ban from the (possibly staler) clients
  table. Tests keep the synchronous path (`OFFLINE_BG_TASKS`) with
  `clear_first=True` for cross-test isolation.

### Detection (built-but-unwired features activated)
- **Ed25519 mesh signing (replaces the symmetric-HMAC model).** Gateway mesh
  offers are now signed with a real Ed25519 private key and verified by peers
  using only the public key — a peer can no longer forge another gateway's
  offers (the old model shared an HMAC secret out-of-band). New
  `_gw_sign_offers`/`_gw_verify_offers`/`_canonical_offer_bytes`; `_gw_generate_keypair`
  /`_gw_derive_pubkey` now produce real Ed25519 keys. `_mesh_sync_loop` signs on
  publish (attaches `_sig`) and, on ingress, **only applies offers from a
  registered peer whose signature verifies against its registered public key**
  (logs `mesh_sync_no_sig`/`mesh_sync_no_pubkey`/`mesh_sync_sig_invalid` and
  skips otherwise). **BREAKING for existing mesh deployments:** old HMAC-derived
  keypairs won't verify — all mesh nodes must upgrade together and regenerate
  keypairs. Single-node deployments are unaffected. Degrades gracefully (no
  signing) when `cryptography` is absent (armv7). (`admin/mesh.py`.)
- **WAF kill-switches wired (operator control over the whole WAF layer).** The
  request-smuggling, verb-override, header-injection (SSTI / host-header),
  body-WAF (XXE / proto-pollution / critical-injection), file-upload, GraphQL,
  slowloris, interaction-probe, and per-identity rate-limit detections were all
  built and acting but **not gated by their `*_ENABLED` kill-switches** (so an
  operator couldn't disable a layer) and the signals weren't mapped in
  `SIGNAL_KNOB` (dashboard showed them as always-on). Added the gates
  (`WAF_SMUGGLING/VERB_OVERRIDE/HEADER_INJECTION/BODY/UPLOAD/GRAPHQL/SLOWLORIS_ENABLED`,
  `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`, all default-on, per-vhost overridable) and mapped every
  WAF/interaction signal in `SIGNAL_KNOB`. (`core/proxy_handler.py`.)
- **Threat-intel feeds now enforced.** `reputation.feeds.feeds_check()` was
  defined and its refresh loops ran, but it was **never called** in the request
  path — `feodo-c2`/`cins-rogue`/`urlhaus-malware` were dead. Wired into the
  detector pipeline (in-process set lookup; self-gates on
  `FEODO/CINS/URLHAUS_ENABLED`, all default-off; skips private IPs) + mapped in
  `SIGNAL_KNOB`/`_REASON_METHOD`/latency/descriptions. (`core/proxy_handler.py`.)
- **JS-consistency signals now enforced.** `js_consistency_signals()` (Sec-CH-UA /
  Sec-Fetch coherence → `js-cua-version-mismatch`/`js-mobile-hint-mismatch`/
  `js-fetch-impossible`) was defined but never called; wired + mapped. Gated on
  `JS_CONSISTENCY_ENABLED`. (`core/proxy_handler.py`.)
- **H2 SETTINGS fingerprint now enforced.** `h2fp_signals()`
  (`h2-settings-deny`/`h2-settings-mismatch`) was defined but never called; wired
  + mapped. Gated on `H2_SETTINGS_FP_ENABLED` (default off; needs the fingerproxy
  sidecar). (`core/proxy_handler.py`.)

### Security
- **2FA-at-login bypass closed (HIGH).** `login_submit` minted a full session
  immediately after password verification, ignoring the user's `totp_enabled`
  flag — a user who had enrolled TOTP could authenticate with the password
  alone. Login now issues an unpredictable, server-stored `partial_token`
  (`secrets.token_urlsafe`, not an enumerable HMAC) for 2FA users and requires a
  second POST to `/login/totp` carrying that token + the TOTP (or a one-time
  backup) code before any session is minted. New `totp_verify_endpoint`
  (timing-safe token + code compare, backup-code consumption, IP rate-limited).
  (`admin/users.py`, `proxy.py`.)
- **UPSTREAM hot-reload SSRF guard restored (HIGH).** The `UPSTREAM`
  hot-reload knob validated only scheme + length via a bare lambda — an admin
  (or same-origin XSS hitting `/__config`) could repoint the upstream at
  `169.254.169.254` / `127.0.0.1` / an RFC-1918 host. Re-wired the validator to
  `_upstream_safe_to_reload`, which resolves the host and rejects
  private/loopback/link-local/cloud-metadata ranges (subject to
  `ALLOW_PRIVATE_UPSTREAM`). (`core/proxy_handler.py`.)
- **Session absolute timeout enforced.** `_session_verify` now rejects a session
  more than `SESSION_ABSOLUTE_TIMEOUT` (default 8 h) past its `created_ts`, even
  if the sliding `expires_ts` keeps getting refreshed; `created_ts` is persisted
  and rehydrated so the clock survives a restart (legacy rows with `created_ts=0`
  are not rejected). (`admin/users.py`.)
- **OIDC hardening.** Expired `id_token` now rejected via a strict `exp` re-check
  (PyJWT's `leeway` had allowed tokens up to 30 s past expiry; nbf/iat skew
  tolerance retained). Added `_OIDC_STATE_MAX` (500) cap: `/auth/oidc/login`
  purges expired states then returns 503 at the cap, blocking unauthenticated
  state-spray memory exhaustion. (`admin/oidc.py`.)
- **Honey-cred probe.** Now IP rate-limited (`_probe_rate_limit_ok`) and bans the
  **requester's** own identity — previously it banned the identity the honey key
  was *issued to*, so an attacker who scraped a leaked key from a victim's HTML
  could get that victim banned by probing it. (`core/proxy_handler.py`.)
- **RFC-7239 `Forwarded` + `X-Forwarded-Prefix` stripped** from inbound requests
  (same spoof surface as the `X-Forwarded-*` family). (`core/proxy_handler.py`.)
- **SSRF guard fails closed on DNS failure.** `_ssrf_guard_url` raised nothing
  (let the URL through) on `gaierror`; now raises so an unresolvable host can't
  dodge the private-range check at config-write time. (`core/proxy_handler.py`.)
- **Per-vhost `ALLOWED_METHODS` now enforced.** The Layer-0 / post-WebSocket
  method checks read the global set; switched to `vc("ALLOWED_METHODS")` so a
  per-vhost override actually applies. (`core/proxy_handler.py`.)
- **Admin-probe label no longer forgeable.** The admin-namespace 404 classifier
  emitted a catch-all `internal-probe`; split into an HMAC-validated
  `operator-self` (valid signed session) vs `admin-probe` (unauthenticated
  recon) so a scanner can't dodge the recon count by presenting any cookie.
  (`core/proxy_handler.py`.)
- **Per-session random CSRF nonce.** The `agw_csrf` token was
  `HMAC(SESSION_KEY, sid)` — derivable for every session from one secret.
  `_session_create` now mints an independent `secrets.token_urlsafe(24)` nonce,
  stored in the session cache + persisted (rehydrated on restart);
  `_csrf_token_valid` and the middleware self-heal/`__AGW_CSRF__` injection
  compare against it. Backward-compatible: sessions minted before the change
  (or a cold cache in the boot window) fall back to the legacy HMAC, so existing
  cookies keep working. (`admin/users.py`, `admin/auth.py`, `core/middleware.py`.)

### Fixed
- **Kill-switch wiring gaps (`SIGNAL_KNOB`).** 19 emitted detection signals
  (probe/session/rate-limit/host/header/ja4/journey/coordinated/fp families +
  `redirect-maze-bot`) had real, vhost-coercible, hot-reloadable `*_ENABLED`
  knobs but were unmapped in `SIGNAL_KNOB`, so the dashboard kill-switch UI +
  riskbreakdown `knob_state` reported them as always-on and the per-vhost
  override showed no controlling knob. Mapped in both `SIGNAL_KNOB` copies;
  `redirect-maze-bot` also gained its `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS` entry
  (`REDIRECT_MAZE_ENABLED`), `SIGNAL_LABELS`, and description tuple (mirrors
  `tarpit-walk`). Metadata only — enforcement stays the inline `if <KNOB>:` in
  each detector. (`core/proxy_handler.py`.)
- **Postgres correctness fixes** (all 500/data-loss on PG-only deployments;
  SQLite was unaffected):
  - `/secured/path-hits` 500'd on any match — `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ts)` returns
    `Decimal` on PG, breaking `round(now - ts, 1)`. Cast to `::float8`.
  - vhost-breakdown + signal-timeline charts silently dropped final-bucket
    events — PG `CAST(numeric AS INTEGER)` rounds half-up vs SQLite/Python
    truncation. Wrapped the slot math in `FLOOR(...)`. (`admin/settings.py`.)
  - Service-metrics history 500'd on PG — 2-arg `ROUND(AVG(col), 2)` has no
    `round(double precision, integer)` overload. Cast `AVG` to `numeric`.
    (`dashboards/service_metrics.py`.)
- **Shared upstream session now uses `DummyCookieJar`.** The 1.9.5 app-wide
  pooled `ClientSession` kept a default cookie jar, so an upstream `Set-Cookie`
  from one proxied request could persist into another (cross-request cookie
  leak). Cookies are forwarded via headers, so the shared session must not keep
  a jar. (`core/proxy_handler.py`.)
- **Logout clears the `agw_csrf` cookie** (was only clearing the session
  cookie), so a stale CSRF token can't survive into a re-login.
  (`admin/users.py`.)
- **`GET /__config` exposes an `env_pinned` list** so the dashboard can render
  env-locked knobs read-only instead of bouncing off env-pin on Apply.
  Removed dead `_escalate`/`_second_order` locals in `protect()`.
  (`core/proxy_handler.py`.)
- **`test_164` cross-test flake fixed.** `test_v187_db_switch_hotswap.py` set `POSTGRES_DSN` at module-import time, leaking it process-globally and flipping `test_164_db_backend_default_sqlite` into PG mode; removed the import-time env set. Default suite now 1185/0. (`tests/`.)
- **PG-mode stale-test debt.** Updated ~75 tests across 39 files that asserted
  renamed internals or pre-refactor contracts to the current behaviour (verified
  against source; no security control weakened, no test skipped/trivialised).
- **`geo.html` load-status pill test pinned the old static label.** Updated
  `test_geo_html_load_status_ready_text` to the 1.9.5 progress-pill behaviour
  (`Loading N%` → `Ready`, re-armed on every fetch); the literal `Loading Ready`
  no longer exists. (`tests/test_pure.py`.)

### Fixed
- **Light/dark theme is now a true single server-side master.** Every dashboard
  already baked `config_kv['ui_theme']` into `<html data-theme>` on first paint,
  but the toggle's persist call (`POST /antibot-appsec-gateway/secured/ui-theme`)
  had **no registered endpoint** — the request 405'd and was swallowed by the
  toggle's `.catch()`, so the choice only ever lived in the local browser's
  `localStorage` (per-browser, never synced; a fresh browser fell back to a
  dark/OS-preference split between baked and un-baked pages). Built the
  `ui_theme_endpoint` (GET → current master; POST `{"theme":"dark"|"light"}` →
  persists synchronously to `config_kv['ui_theme']`, 400 on invalid, role-gated)
  and registered `GET`/`POST /secured/ui-theme`. Now toggling on ANY page sets
  the master that ALL 11 dashboards reflect on their next load — across browsers
  and devices. Also gave the `main.html` chart-loading overlay a light-mode
  override (it was hardcoded `rgba(13,17,23,0.55)` and stayed dark in day theme).
  (`admin/settings.py`, `db/sqlite.py` `set_ui_theme`, `proxy.py`,
  `dashboards/main.html`; `tests/test_v1811_theme.py` — api01–10, incl. an
  all-dashboards master-reflection test.)
- **Persistent IP ban now shows as "Banned" in the dashboard (was "allowed").**
  The raw-IP ban (`ip_bans` table, checked via `check_ip_ban_cached` — survives
  session-cookie / fingerprint rotation) is independent of the in-memory identity
  ban (`s.banned_until`). An IP in the hostile pool whose identity risk had since
  decayed below threshold rendered a green **allowed** badge in the reason-details
  popup and the ALLOWED/BLOCKED/MISSED tabs — even though every request was being
  silent-decoyed (the ban *was* enforced; only the label was wrong). The clients
  dump (`metrics_endpoint`) now exposes an `ip_banned` flag (probed only for
  not-already-identity-banned clients, via the TTL ban cache); the dashboard
  treats it as banned in `_clientCats`, the reason-details status, and the
  client-detail status line. Added the missing `ip-ban` entry to `REASON_INFO`
  (was "tier INFO, weight 0, No description available"). (`core/proxy_handler.py`,
  `dashboards/main.html`; `tests/test_v197_ip_ban_status.py`.)

### Operator features (P2 — built-but-unwired backlog completed)
- **Attack Playbook backend.** The Honeypots dashboard's Attack-Playbook +
  honey-suggest cards fetched `/secured/attack-playbook` and
  `/secured/honey-suggest`, but neither endpoint existed (the cards rendered
  "HTTP 404"). Built `attack_playbook_endpoint` (honeypot-family catches grouped
  by exact reason with capped distinct examples + `last_ts`/`capped`; scanner-tool
  fingerprinting from the **full per-IP path set** — nuclei/nikto/wpscan/sqlmap/
  feroxbuster signatures, ≥2 hits → fingerprint; signature-completion
  `predicted_probes` minus already-trapped paths) and `honey_suggest_endpoint`
  (frequently-probed 4xx paths not yet trapped, last 7 days). Both read the
  `vhost` query param (lowercased) and push it into the DB read so the dashboard
  vhost selector actually filters; routes registered in `proxy.py`.
  (`core/proxy_handler.py`, `proxy.py`; `tests/test_v1810_attack_playbook.py`,
  `tests/test_v1813_honeypot_vhost_filter.py`.)
- **`PRESERVE_HOST` knob.** Opt-in (default False, per-vhost, hot-reloadable):
  when set, the forward path skips Host/Origin/Referer rewriting and passes the
  client's original Host to upstream (X-Forwarded-Host always carries the client
  host regardless). Gated in both the HTTP and WebSocket forward paths.
  (`config.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`, `vhost.py`;
  `tests/test_v1814_preserve_host_qa.py`.)
- **VACUUM history + concurrency guards.** Each SQLite VACUUM now records a
  `gw_audit` row (`action='db_vacuum'`, saved_bytes/duration_ms/ok) and the
  response + `GET /secured/db-vacuum-history` return the last 5 runs (newest
  first, via the new `_vacuum_history` helper). `db_vacuum_endpoint` now refuses
  with **409** while a background migration is in flight (`_BG_MIGRATION`, set by
  `proxy._resume_pending_bg_migration`) or a concurrent VACUUM holds
  `_DB_VACUUM_LOCK`; the run is single-flighted under the lock.
  (`core/proxy_handler.py`, `proxy.py`; `tests/test_v1815_vacuum_history.py`.)
- **`BLOCK_RESPONSE_MODE="404"` now serves the upstream 404 body** instead of
  falling through to the homepage decoy. The silent-decoy responder branches
  api/admin → JSON 404, `"404"` → cached upstream-404 body (primed via
  `_fetch_upstream_404`), else homepage. (`core/proxy_handler.py`;
  `tests/test_v1815_block_response_mode_qa.py`.)

## [1.9.6] — 2026-06-20 — dashboard responsiveness (/__metrics response cache)

### Performance
- **`/__metrics` short-TTL response cache.** Every open dashboard polls this
  endpoint ~every 2 s, and a full computation iterates all `ip_state` + events +
  a **synchronous** timeline DB query — all on the single event loop, so two
  near-simultaneous loads (e.g. clicking between two pages) stalled the UI while
  the second waited for the first to finish. The endpoint now serves a cached
  JSON result for ~1 s (keyed by the full query string; admin-only, so no
  per-user data), so rapid/concurrent identical requests reuse a recent result
  instead of recomputing on the loop. TTL is env-configurable
  (`METRICS_RESP_TTL`, default `1.0`; tests set `0`). Cache is bounded FIFO.
  (`core/proxy_handler.py`; `tests/test_v196_metrics_cache.py`.)
- Read-only/display path only — no change to detection, scoring, banning, or
  proxying. At most ~1 s data staleness on a dashboard that already polls at 2 s.

### Fixed
- **`/secured/logs-data` returned 500 on Postgres-only deployments.** `r["ts"]`
  is a `TIMESTAMPTZ` `datetime` on PG (not JSON-serializable), so the Logs
  dashboard's data endpoint 500'd. Added a `_epoch()` coercion helper
  (datetime→epoch float, SQLite REAL passthrough, null-safe) on the ts output.
  Found while running the full PG-mode suite. (`core/proxy_handler.py`;
  `tests/test_v196_pg_datetime_and_writer.py`.)
- **`db_writer_loop` crashed with `task_done() called too many times` on
  shutdown/cancellation.** `batch` was assigned inside the `try`, so a
  `CancelledError` during `await db_queue.get()` left a stale prior-iteration
  batch that the `finally` re-`task_done()`'d. Reset `batch = []` before the
  `try` in both writer-loop variants. Cleaner production shutdown; also un-stuck
  5 PG-mode test files that this defect was hard-crashing. (`db/sqlite.py`.)
- **Dashboard background flipped dark↔light when navigating between pages.** Only
  5 of 11 dashboards baked the persisted UI theme into the served `<html>` tag;
  the other 6 (main, agents, siem, geo, logs, control_center) shipped without
  `data-theme`, so their `<head>` init script fell back to the OS
  `prefers-color-scheme` — flipping the theme between the two groups when the
  saved choice differed from the OS setting. Added one shared helper
  `db.sqlite.inject_theme(html, db_path)` and routed every dashboard through it
  (the previously-broken 6 now inject; honeypots refactored to the helper too).
  A source-scan guard test fails if any dashboard HTML is ever served raw.
  (`db/sqlite.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`, `dashboards/{agents,siem,honeypots}.py`;
  `tests/test_v196_dashboard_theme_injection.py`.)
- **Service page "7 days" window showed only ~1 day (PG-only deployments).**
  `db/sqlite.py::db_load_state()` rehydrated the in-memory `SERVICE_METRICS_HISTORY`
  buffer at boot from the **local SQLite file** (its hard-coded
  `conn = _sqlite_connect(DB_PATH)`). In PG-only mode the db-writer mirrors
  `svc_metric` rows to Postgres and never touches local SQLite, so that file is
  frozen at the pre-cutover state — rehydrating from it loaded **stale samples
  with old timestamps**. Those made the deque's oldest entry look weeks old,
  which fooled `service_metrics_data_endpoint`'s `start_b < _buf_oldest`
  heuristic into taking the in-memory path (stale gap + most-recent live
  samples) instead of the backend-aware DB path — so long windows rendered only
  the most-recent ~1 day even though Postgres held the full history (observed on
  pt4.tech: 9 days in PG, 1 day shown). Fixed by rehydrating through
  `open_conn()` (backend-aware, the same pattern `_rehydrate_timeline` already
  uses), so PG-only deployments load a **contiguous recent buffer from
  Postgres**. SQLite-only deployments are unaffected (`open_conn()` returns the
  same file). Buffer is cleared before rehydration (repeat-`on_startup` safety)
  and still bounded by `SERVICE_METRICS_RETENTION`. The last read path in
  `db_load_state` that wasn't made backend-aware in 1.9.1 iter-18.

### Tests
- `tests/test_v196_metrics_cache.py` — `/__metrics` short-TTL response cache.
- `tests/test_v195_svc_rehydrate_backend_aware.py` (**7 tests**) — the
  svc_metrics rehydration reads through `open_conn()` (not the local-SQLite
  `conn`), closes its connection in `finally`, clears the deque first, keeps the
  `LIMIT SERVICE_METRICS_RETENTION` bound, swallows boot errors with the
  `db_svc_metrics_not_loaded` slog, and (belt-and-braces) no `conn.execute(…
  svc_metrics …)` remains on the local-SQLite connection anywhere in
  `db_load_state`.

## [1.9.5] — 2026-06-19 — hot-path performance (shared upstream pool + ban-lookup cache)

### Changed (performance)

- **#1 — Shared, connection-pooled upstream `ClientSession`.** `proxy()` previously opened a brand-new `ClientSession` (and `TCPConnector`) on **every** forwarded request — a fresh TCP connect + TLS handshake per request, no keep-alive. Now a single app-lifetime session with a pooled `TCPConnector` (`UPSTREAM_POOL_LIMIT`=200, `UPSTREAM_KEEPALIVE_SECS`=30) is created lazily on first use and reused across all requests; closed in `on_cleanup`. **Measured (local HTTP backend): upstream-forward latency −86% (0.816→0.111 ms/req), throughput 7.4× (1.2k→9.0k req/s).** Larger still for HTTPS/remote upstreams (eliminates the per-request TLS handshake).
- **#3 — TTL cache for the per-request IP-ban lookup.** `check_ip_ban()`/`check_ip_ban_vhost()` each opened a short-lived SQLite connection + point query on the event loop for every non-admin request. New `check_ip_ban_cached()`/`check_ip_ban_vhost_cached()` serve hot IPs from memory (`BAN_CACHE_TTL_SECS`=5); the db-writer **invalidates the cache on every ban insert/delete**, so a fresh ban is enforced immediately (the TTL only ever delays a *negative* result, and this lookup is defence-in-depth — identity + risk bans still apply). **Measured: 120.3 → 0.21 µs/call (575×), ~120 µs of blocking disk I/O removed per request.**

Combined, the two changes remove a fixed **~0.83 ms/request** independent of the rest of the pipeline → roughly **−30–45% end-to-end latency / ~1.5–1.8× throughput** for a local-upstream deployment.

### Tests

- `tests/test_v195_perf_session_and_bancache.py` (**10 tests**) — shared session reuse + pooled connector + recreate-after-close + `on_cleanup` wiring + `proxy()` no longer per-request; ban cache hit/miss/negative-TTL/expired-ban-reread/invalidation/vhost + writer invalidates all 4 ban ops.

### Fixed (iteration — Postgres timestamp comparison in filtered metrics — 2026-06-19)

- **`/secured/metrics` and `/secured/cost-timeline` with `?path=` / `?vhost=` filters threw `operator does not exist: timestamp with time zone >= integer` on Postgres.** The filtered-timeline branch in `metrics_endpoint` (`core/proxy_handler.py:5605-5617`) was running `WHERE ts >= ? AND ts <= ?` against the `events` table without backend-branching. On SQLite `events.ts` is `REAL` (epoch float) so the raw bind works; on Postgres `events.ts` is `TIMESTAMPTZ` and psycopg routes the float through as integer/numeric, which PG can't compare. The outer `try/except Exception` swallowed the error and silently fell through to *unfiltered* data — operator still got a dashboard, but their path/vhost drill-down filter was a no-op. Visible in the TimescaleDB container logs as repeated `STATEMENT: SELECT ts, path, reason FROM events WHERE ts >= $1 AND ts <= $2 AND vhost = $3 ORDER BY ts` ERROR lines. Fixed by backend-branching the SQL: PG variant wraps the epoch bounds with `to_timestamp(?)` and projects `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ts) AS ts` (the projection is critical — without it, the downstream `int(row["ts"])` raises `TypeError` because psycopg returns TIMESTAMPTZ as a Python `datetime`). Same pattern as the sibling `/secured/scoring` block one screen up.

### Tests (iteration)

- `tests/test_v195_metrics_path_filter_pg_ts.py` (**6 tests**) — both structural (no inline unbranched `ts >= ?` against events without a nearby `to_timestamp(?)` PG branch) and `metrics_endpoint`-specific (backend check present, PG uses `to_timestamp` for both bounds + `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ts) AS ts` projection, SQLite path unchanged, SELECT uses the `_ts_col` interpolation variable so a future "simplify back to one query" PR fails the test).

## [1.9.4] — 2026-06-17 — in-memory hardening + dashboard UX + restart-resilient charts

### Security
- **Audit-log evasion via malformed UTF-8 (fuzzing-found).** A request carrying
  lone surrogates / invalid UTF-8 in UA or path made psycopg raise
  `UnicodeEncodeError`, which silently DROPPED the event (and the client upsert)
  from the Postgres store — letting an attacker keep their requests out of the PG
  audit log / SIEM. `db/postgres.py::_pg_safe` now replaces un-encodable code
  points at both PG-write entry points (`pg_insert_event`, `_pg_dispatch_op`);
  the row is stored instead of dropped. (`tests/test_v194_pg_surrogate_sanitize.py`.)

### Added
- **`by_path` / `by_ja4` cardinality cap (FIFO, 2048).** `metrics["by_path"]`,
  `by_path_by_cat[*]` and `metrics["by_ja4"]` are client-controllable and were
  unbounded — a path-enumeration / TLS-churn flood could grow them until the
  process was OOM-killed. `core/metrics.py::_bump_capped` now evicts oldest-first.
- **Chart loading overlay** on the Live Feed dashboard — spinner over each chart
  until first paint (no more blank-canvas-on-load); failsafe sweep after 8 s.

### Fixed
- **Live Feed timeline survives a gateway restart.** `db.sqlite::_rehydrate_timeline`
  repopulates the in-memory minute-bucket dict from the (backend-aware) `timeline`
  table at startup; the recent window no longer renders blank after a restart even
  though events were always safe in the DB.
- **Controls page load** — `loadBans()` uses `/metrics?view=bans` (server skips the
  full per-identity dump + timeline build), cutting the 4 s-refresh cost from
  O(all-identities) to O(banned).
- **Defense Thresholds slider** — 0-value knob draggable again; click-track-to-set.
- **PG "still starting" (SQLSTATE 57P03)** classified as a self-healing transient —
  calm log instead of a stack trace; bounded startup retry.
- **Backend-aware persistence banner** — PG-only mode no longer prints the local
  SQLite path as if it were the live store.
- **Login theme `<script>` CSP nonce** — was blocked by `script-src 'nonce-…'`.

### Tests
- `test_v194_inmem_bounds_rehydrate.py` (cap + rehydrate), `test_v193_metrics_bans_view.py`,
  `test_v193_pg_starting_classifier.py`; de-staled OIDC + vhost_stats + geo tests after
  the module refactor.

## [1.9.3] — 2026-06-12 — config_kv backend self-heal + release roll-up

Promotes the 1.9.2 iter-21→23 Postgres-resilience work to a tagged release and closes the last loose end.

### Changed

- **Settings "Database backend" toggle no longer flashes "SQLite" on load.** It now starts in a neutral loading state (grey track, hidden thumb, ⏳ hourglass, both labels dimmed) and only reveals the real backend once `loadDb()` resolves — so Postgres deployments never momentarily show SQLite. (`dashboards/settings.html`; `tests/test_v193_db_backend_loading_hourglass.py`, 5 tests.)

### Fixed

- **Stale `config_kv` `DB_BACKEND="sqlite"` row no longer lingers.** iter-23 made `POSTGRES_DSN` authoritative by forcing the *runtime* backend to postgres, but the stale persisted *row* survived — so the `db_backend_forced_pg_by_dsn` warning recurred on every boot and any UI reading the persisted value could still show "sqlite". `db/sqlite.py::db_load_config` now **self-heals the row**: after coercing, it rewrites the `config_kv` `DB_BACKEND` value to `postgres` (backend-aware synchronous `UPDATE`, logged as `db_backend_row_self_healed`). No manual `DELETE FROM config_kv` needed; the warning stops after the first boot on this build. Best-effort — a write failure never blocks boot (the runtime backend is already correct).

### Rolled up from 1.9.2 (now shipped under 1.9.3)

- **iter-21** — Postgres auto-recovery watchdog (re-enables PG without a restart once it's reachable again after a failure).
- **iter-22** — `/secured/db-test` hang fix (Timescale `COUNT(*)` → planner estimate; blocking probes offloaded to a thread executor + bounded).
- **iter-23** — `POSTGRES_DSN` authority (persisted `sqlite` can't override) + boot SQLite→Postgres event gap back-fill (crash-safe, idempotent).

### Tests

- `tests/test_v192_pg_authority_and_backfill.py` — +1 guard (`test_db_load_config_self_heals_stale_backend_row`) for the row rewrite (8 total in file).
- `tests/test_v189_sidebar_collapse.py` — brand-version anchor bumped 1.9.2 → 1.9.3.

---

## [1.9.2 iter-23] — 2026-06-12 — POSTGRES_DSN authority + boot gap back-fill

### Fixed

- **`POSTGRES_DSN` set but gateway silently ran on SQLite.** For `DB_BACKEND`, a persisted `config_kv` value overrode the env (by design, so the dashboard backend-switch survives restart) — but a *stale* persisted `DB_BACKEND="sqlite"` (from an earlier SQLite run or a pre-PG-only-migration switch) then kept the gateway on SQLite **even with a healthy Postgres and a DSN set**. Result on pt4.tech: 8.3M events in PG, then a ~1.5h gap as new events went to the local SQLite file. `db/sqlite.py::db_load_config` now **coerces a persisted `DB_BACKEND` to `postgres` whenever `POSTGRES_DSN` is set** (logs `db_backend_forced_pg_by_dsn`). A DSN now unambiguously means Postgres.

### Added

- **Boot-time SQLite→Postgres event gap back-fill** (`db/postgres.py::_backfill_events_gap_from_sqlite`, wired into `on_startup`). On a PG-mode boot, any events that piled up in the local SQLite store while the gateway was on SQLite are imported into Postgres — every row **newer than PG's `max(ts)`**, so the timeline becomes contiguous with no manual `python -m db.import`. Safety: clean no-op (never crashes boot) when there's no local SQLite file, no events table, or no gap; idempotent (`ts > pg_max` bound composes with the first-boot auto-import — no double-insert); batched + capped (logs a warning to finish manually if the cap is hit).

### Tests

- `tests/test_v192_pg_authority_and_backfill.py` (**7 tests**) — back-fill imports only `ts > pg_max`; no-gap / missing-file / no-events-table / no-DSN all clean no-ops; `db_load_config` coerces backend when DSN set; back-fill wired into `on_startup`.

---

## [1.9.2 iter-22] — 2026-06-12 — db-test endpoint hang fix (Timescale COUNT + event-loop block)

### Fixed

- **`/secured/db-test` hung 40+ s and stalled the whole worker on the live pt4.tech (Timescale) deployment.** Two compounding bugs:
  - **`db/postgres.py::pg_db_size()` ran an unbounded `COUNT(*)` over the events table.** On a Timescale hypertable that full-scans every chunk (seconds → minutes as the table grows). Replaced with a planner **estimate** — `SUM(reltuples)` over the table + its inheritance children (Timescale chunks are inheritance children of the hypertable root) — a catalog-only read that's instant and accurate enough for a dashboard figure (kept fresh by ANALYZE/autovacuum).
  - **`core/proxy_handler.py::db_test_endpoint` called the blocking probes (`pg_test_roundtrip`, `pg_db_size`) directly on the event loop.** A slow Postgres therefore froze the entire async worker — every concurrent admin request (`/secured/vhosts`, `/secured/config`, …) timed out with a 502. Both probes are now offloaded to a thread executor and bounded with `asyncio.wait_for` (8s for the roundtrip, 6s for the size query); on timeout the endpoint returns a clean `ok:false, reason:"probe timed out"` instead of hanging.

### Tests

- `tests/test_v192_db_test_no_blocking_count.py` (**3 tests**) — `pg_db_size` uses a reltuples estimate and never exact-counts events; `db_test_endpoint` offloads via `run_in_executor` + `wait_for`; `pg_db_size` returns fast when PG is unconfigured.

---

## [1.9.2 iter-21] — 2026-06-12 — Postgres auto-recovery (no-restart self-heal)

### Added

- **Postgres backend now self-heals after a failure — no operator restart required.** Previously, any Postgres failure (`db_init_postgres` auth rejection, container restart, network blip, or a password drift later corrected) called `_disable_postgres_for_process`, which latched the backend OFF for the life of the process: the gateway silently degraded to SQLite and stayed there — **empty dashboards, dead geo-data / event reads** — until someone restarted the container. This was the root cause of the pt4.tech "no events" + `geo-data 500` / `vhosts 502` incident after a Timescale restart.
  - `db/postgres.py` — the disable is now *recoverable*: it records **why** it went down (`_PG_DISABLED_BY_FAILURE`, `_PG_DISABLED_TS`) rather than latching permanently.
  - `pg_recovery_probe()` — a direct connect + `SELECT 1`, bypassing the pool and the auth latch, to test whether Postgres is reachable **and** authable again. Never raises.
  - `pg_maybe_recover()` — cheap no-op while PG is healthy; when disabled-by-failure it probes once and, on success, calls `_reenable_postgres_for_process()` which clears the auth latch, flips `_postgres_available` back on across every module, restores `DB_BACKEND=postgres` on `core.proxy_handler`, and bumps `_PG_RECOVERED_COUNT`.
  - `proxy.py::_pg_recovery_loop()` — background watchdog started in `on_startup` whenever a Postgres DSN is configured. Probes every `PG_RECOVERY_PROBE_SECS` (default **15s**, floored at 5s, env-tunable) **only while the backend is disabled** — zero steady-state cost when PG is healthy. The blocking connect runs in a thread executor so it never stalls the event loop.
  - `dashboards/service_metrics.py` (`/services`) now surfaces `pg_disabled_by_failure`, `pg_disabled_ts`, `pg_recovered_count`, `pg_recovery_probe_secs` so operators can see "degraded → auto-recovery active" and how many times it self-healed.

### Tests

- `tests/test_v193_pg_auto_recovery.py` (**11 tests**) — disable records the failure reason; re-enable fully reverses it (latch, `_postgres_available`, `DB_BACKEND`); `maybe_recover` is a no-op while healthy (must not probe); re-enables on probe success; stays disabled (and retries) on probe failure; probe safe without a DSN and swallows connect errors; interval floor; loop coroutine wired into `proxy`.

---

## [1.9.2 iter-20] — 2026-06-11 — agents-timeline diagnostics + idle-timeout default

### Fixed

- **Agents `Detection vs Miss · Timeline` chart's "Stale — chart fetch failed" had no triage path.** Two layers:
  - **Backend** — `dashboards/agents.py`: `print(f"[agents-timeline] db error: {e}")` → `slog("agents_timeline_db_err", level="error", backend=…, exc_type=…, error=…)`. Now visible in the in-process `/__logs` ring, not stdout-only.
  - **Frontend** — `dashboards/agents.html::tickChart()`: explicit `Content-Type` guard before `r.json()`. When the endpoint returns the silent-decoy HTML (admin session revoked by idle timeout, absolute timeout, or Cloudflare-stripped cookie), the chart's "Stale" tooltip now reads *"Session likely expired or stripped by CDN (got 404 text/html). Refresh the page and re-login if asked."* instead of the misleading *"Stale — chart fetch failed: SyntaxError…"*.

### Changed

- **`SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT` default raised 1800s → 3600s** (`config.py`). 30 minutes was tight for active dashboard use — operators stepping away briefly were getting silently revoked, then every subsequent admin request returned the decoy HTML. 1 hour balances UX vs the `SESSION_ABSOLUTE_TIMEOUT` 8-hour hard cap. Operators wanting tighter or looser can still override via env.

---

## [1.9.2] — 2026-06-11 — posture wizard + PG-only-mode read sweep (iter-13→18)

### Added

- **Security-posture wizard expanded + 4th preset.** Per-vhost preset
  bundles grew 14 → 25 knobs (all vhost-overridable thresholds + detector
  toggles). New **Paranoid** profile (Turnstile + tightest thresholds);
  red `.p-paranoid` badge. (iter-13)
- **Profile-impact radar.** 5-axis SVG radar (bot-block / user-friction /
  threat-coverage / rate-limit / response-strictness) overlaying all 4
  profiles. (iter-14)
- **Global posture wizard on the Controls page** — same radar + 4 cards;
  Apply targets global `/secured/config`. (iter-15)

### Fixed — PG-only-mode silent-empty reads

In PG-only mode the writer "never touches SQLite", but many reads still
opened a bare `sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)` → blank dashboards:

- **iter-16** (4): SIEM sparkline (was raising `operator does not exist:
  timestamp with time zone >= integer`), reason-over-time chart, dow×hour
  heatmap, Service per-vhost totals.
- **iter-17** (17): Agents timeline buckets, vhost block-rate heatmap,
  incident feed, ban-event timeline, geo cursor/target-points,
  path-detail, agents bucket-detail. PG path wraps bounds in
  `to_timestamp(?)` + `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ts)`.
- **iter-18** (5): svc_metrics history, OIDC SSO provisioning (also
  `INSERT OR IGNORE`→`ON CONFLICT`), config_kv dismissed-hosts read+write
  (`INSERT OR REPLACE`→`ON CONFLICT`), gw_audit log viewer.

### Tests

- `test_v1814_posture_presets.py` (28), `test_v191_iter15_global_posture_wizard.py` (15),
  `test_v191_iter16_pg_events_reads.py` (6),
  `test_v191_iter17_pg_events_read_guard.py` (events guard),
  `test_v191_iter17_sweep_qa.py` (17 anchored), and
  **`test_v191_iter18_mirrored_table_guard.py`** — superset guard: any
  bare-sqlite read of ANY of the ~24 PG-mirrored tables fails CI unless
  the function early-returns on `DB_BACKEND != "sqlite"`.

### Validation

`validation/1.9.1.md` (iter-10→18 records; retained under that filename —
work spans the 1.9.1→1.9.2 transition). Harbor manifest `:1.9.2` →
`sha256:dd5740d007084f5d88664875e665a049245b886712d0caefc33d07f27009fac2`.

---

## [1.9.2] — 2026-06-11 — config_kv / secrets_kv backend-aware load

### Fixed

- **Dashboard knobs no longer reset on every upgrade for PG-mode deploys.** `db_load_config` and `db_load_secrets` (in `db/sqlite.py`) opened SQLite directly at `DB_PATH` regardless of `active_backend()`. On PG-mode deployments with an ephemeral `/data` volume — common in HA / Kubernetes setups — the read returned no rows even when Postgres had every saved setting (mirrored via `_pg_mirror_bg`). Operator symptom: every `docker compose up` after an image upgrade reverted all Controls / Thresholds knobs to env defaults.
  - Both loaders now consult `db.conn.active_backend()`; when it returns `"postgres"`, the read routes through `db.conn.conn()` which connects to PG via the configured DSN.
  - The legacy SQLite branch keeps the `g.get("DB_PATH") or os.environ.get("DB_PATH") or DB_PATH` resolution so tests that override `DB_PATH` at runtime still work.
  - Failure log line now includes `backend=<sqlite|postgres>` for clean triage when load fails (e.g. PG transiently unreachable on cold boot).
  - **No version bump** — point-fix on 1.9.2; rebuilding the same tag with the patch baked in.

### Tests

- `tests/test_v192_config_canonical_pg.py` — 5 source-anchor tests pinning the routing contract (active_backend() consulted; PG branch uses `db.conn.conn`; SQLite branch preserves DB_PATH resolution; except clause is `Exception` not `sqlite3.Error`; load-failed log includes `backend=`).

---

## [1.9.2] — 2026-06-11 — full-suite audit: completed dormant features

A full-suite audit ("check everything") found ~75 red/errored specs describing
features that shipped knobs/UI/tests but were never wired end-to-end. All wired
test-driven; full suite now **1185 passed / 0 failed / 0 errors**.

### Added / completed

- **OIDC SSO — real id_token verification + pending-approval flow.** The
  callback now REQUIRES and cryptographically verifies the `id_token`:
  `_verify_id_token()` checks the JWKS-resolved RS/PS/ES signature
  (`_OIDC_ALLOWED_ALGS` — no HS*/none, alg-confusion guard), `iss`/`aud`/`exp`/
  `nbf` (±30 s leeway), required `iat`/`exp`/`sub`, and the login `nonce`; one
  forced JWKS refresh tolerates key rotation, keys cached 1 h (`_JWKS_CACHE`).
  New SSO users are provisioned `status='pending', sso_source='oidc'` via a
  direct `sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)` write and get **404 (no session)** until an
  admin activates them. INT4-10 sub-binding: `id_token.sub` must equal
  `userinfo.sub`. Errors redirect with OPAQUE `_ERROR_CODES` (never a reflected
  IdP/exception string); the login page maps the code to a fixed safe message.
  Session cookie hardened to `SameSite=Strict`.
- **Interaction probe route** — registered the public `POST interaction-report`
  endpoint (the `detection/interaction.py` analyser already existed, the route
  was never wired).
- **Login CSP nonce** — `login_page_endpoint` now mints a per-request nonce,
  substitutes `__CSP_NONCE__`, and serves a strict `script-src 'self'
  'nonce-…'` CSP (F-11; no `unsafe-inline`) so the inline Sign-in handler runs
  while injected inline scripts stay blocked.

### Fixed (post-ship hotfix)

- **Security — maintainer→admin privilege escalation (S-C1).** `users_update_endpoint`
  gated non-self updates as `admin,maintainer` then only blocked `viewer` from
  the role field, so a **maintainer could PATCH any user's role to `admin`**.
  Role changes are now **admin-only** (`if caller_role != "admin"`); maintainer
  password/status edits are unaffected.
- **Security — gateway private-key disclosure to maintainers (S-W3).**
  `gw_registry_get_endpoint?reveal=1` was gated `admin,maintainer`, letting a
  **maintainer exfiltrate the local gateway private key**. The `?reveal=1`
  branch is now **admin-only**; maintainers still read registry metadata.
- **Accepted risk — 2FA (TOTP) is dormant/incomplete (R4).** Frontend
  (settings enrollment card + login TOTP step), helpers and schema exist, but
  `2fa-setup` is unrouted, there is no enrollment-confirm endpoint
  (`totp_enabled` is only ever set via DB import), and `login_submit` does not
  step-up on `totp_enabled`. In normal operation 2FA cannot be enabled, so there
  is no active bypass — **risk accepted** (validation §11b R4). Owner Pedro
  Tarrinho; revisit if 2FA is built out.
- **Emergency `BYPASS_MODE` could not disable the gateway on a vhost
  deployment.** The site-wide bypass gate read `vc('BYPASS_MODE')`, which
  resolves the *per-vhost* override first — so a vhost whose `VHOSTS` overlay
  carried `BYPASS_MODE=False` silently **shadowed the global kill-switch**: the
  operator flipped emergency bypass on but detection/bans kept firing on that
  vhost ("não dá para desativar a GW"). The gate now fires when **either** the
  global `BYPASS_MODE` (emergency, un-shadowable) **or** the per-vhost value is
  true: `if (BYPASS_MODE or vc('BYPASS_MODE')) and not _is_admin_path(...)`. A
  per-vhost `BYPASS_MODE=True` still enables pass-through for a single vhost.
  (Bypass-position source-guards updated to the broadened condition.)
- **Two-level "disable protections" controls.** Explicit global + per-vhost
  off-switches for the whole pipeline. **Global** (Controls bypass bar): the
  emergency `BYPASS_MODE` — disables ALL protections (detection, bans, rate
  limits) on *every* vhost; session-only (resets on restart) so a forgotten
  panic toggle can't outlive the incident; un-shadowable. **Per-vhost** (Vhost
  Policy → new "Disable ALL protections" danger switch): sets `BYPASS_MODE` for
  that vhost only and **persists** across restarts (deliberate policy via
  `vhost_set`); other vhosts unaffected; the global bypass still overrides
  everywhere. Dashboard labels clarified to distinguish the two scopes.
- **Health-score block-ratio query crashed on Postgres/Timescale.** The inline
  last-hour aggregation `SELECT reason, COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE ts >= ?` in
  `health_score` ran through `open_conn()` (a PG wrapper on the Postgres
  backend) but compared the `timestamptz` `events.ts` column against a raw epoch
  float → `operator does not exist: timestamp with time zone >= double
  precision`. SQLite coerces silently so it only showed on PG: the error was
  swallowed by `except: pass` (block-ratio always read "low traffic") **and**
  spammed the Timescale error log on every dashboard refresh. Now backend-aware
  — `to_timestamp(?)` on Postgres, plain float compare on SQLite (matching the
  existing `db/postgres.py` readers). Pre-existing latent bug, not introduced
  this release.

### Security

- **SSRF guard for UPSTREAM hot-reload** — new `_upstream_safe_to_reload()`
  rejects non-http(s)/schemeless/over-long URLs and hosts resolving to private/
  loopback/link-local/metadata ranges (built on `_ssrf_guard_url`);
  `ALLOW_PRIVATE_UPSTREAM` bypasses for trusted internal deployments.
- **Host-header reflection guard** — when `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is set, an unlisted
  (attacker-controlled) `Host` is no longer reflected into the rewritten
  `Location`; the gateway falls back to the upstream netloc (open-redirect /
  cache-poisoning fix).
- **Defence-in-depth hardening** (post-review, from the secure code review's
  low-severity findings): the SSRF guard now unwraps **NAT64** (`64:ff9b::/96`)
  addresses so a NAT64 literal can't smuggle a private/loopback IPv4;
  `_verify_id_token` requires a **concrete `kid` match** (a kid-less token no
  longer matches a key-less JWK entry); `_fetch_jwks` **refuses a non-TLS JWKS
  URL** (loopback exempt) to block plaintext key-injection; per-vhost
  `RISK_OVERRIDES` weights are **clamped to `[0, 10000]`** (negative/absurd
  values rejected).

### Tests

- Implemented features turn green: `test_oidc` (73), `test_v1811_oidc_idtoken_verify`
  (20), `test_pentest_probes` (38), `test_login_csp_nonce` (3),
  `test_interaction_probe` (52), `test_audit_trail` (60).
- Aligned stale tests to the shipped contract (documented in-test):
  `test_h4_pg_backend_switch` os._exit/`_startup_postgres_schema` (1.8.7 hot-swap
  → 1.9.0 restart-based switch); `test_audit_trail` pg `gw_audit_add` (op-ladder
  → A4 `_PG_OP_HANDLERS` registry); `test_integration` location-rewrite pinned
  `ALLOWED_HOSTS=∅` (immune to cross-test leakage under the new host guard).


## [1.9.2] — 2026-06-10 — per-vhost ban scope

### Added

- **`BAN_SCOPE` knob** (`global` default / `vhost`) — controls ban
  blast-radius. `global` (default, backward-compatible): a behaviour-earned
  ban locks the identity/IP out across all vhosts. `vhost`: the ban applies
  only to the vhost where the bad behaviour was observed; the same identity
  can still use other vhosts. Hot-reloadable AND per-vhost overridable (set
  per hostname in the `VHOSTS` JSON), so one gateway can run mixed policy.

### Changed

- **New `ip_bans_vhost` table** (composite PK `(ip, vhost)`) holds vhost-scoped
  bans; legacy `ip_bans` untouched (additive — no PK rebuild, no migration
  step, no downtime, safe rollback). `IpState.banned_until_by_vhost` carries
  the in-memory per-vhost expiry, rehydrated on boot (`vhost_bans_rehydrated`).
  New dispatch ops `ip_ban_vhost` / `ip_ban_vhost_del` (M11 arity 5/2,
  golden-SQL frozen). `PG_SCHEMA_VERSION 1→2` (additive; A5 tolerates ±1 so a
  rollback to 1.9.1 ignores the new table). Global bans always win;
  `BAN_SCOPE=vhost` only ADDS per-vhost isolation for new bans.

### Fixed

- **Host allowlist (Layer-0) now exempts admin paths.** With `VHOSTS`
  configured (implicit-vhost-allowlist branch on), an admin request via the
  server IP / localhost was silently decoyed as `host-not-allowed`, locking
  the operator out of the dashboard unless they hit an exact vhost hostname.
  Admin paths are already IP-allowlist + session gated, so Host matching adds
  nothing there; now exempt (same pattern as the iter-10 method gate).
- **iter-11b — per-vhost risk accumulation (TRUE isolation).** `BAN_SCOPE=vhost`
  scoped the ban *storage* per-vhost but the `risk_score` was still global, so
  an identity that built up risk on vhost A was banned on vhost B the moment it
  touched it (carry-over). Risk now accumulates per-vhost
  (`IpState.risk_by_vhost`, decays in lockstep) and the threshold is evaluated
  against the per-vhost score, so behaviour on one vhost can no longer ban the
  identity on another it has not abused. Verified live (attack jtsl → jtsl
  banned, pt4 untouched stays `200`) and by controlled unit test (global score
  424, pt4 per-vhost score 24 < 50 → pt4 free; pt4 still bans on its own 56≥50).
- **`unban_endpoint` full scrub restored + extended.** The single-target unban
  cleared only `risk_score`/`banned_until`, not the risk breakdown — a leftover
  score could re-ban the identity on its next request (the bulk endpoint already
  scrubbed fully; the two are now symmetric). Both unban paths additionally
  clear the iter-11b per-vhost maps (`risk_by_vhost`, `banned_until_by_vhost`)
  and DELETE matching `ip_bans_vhost` rows, so an Allow cannot leave a
  vhost-scoped ban behind.

### Completed dead-knob features (consumers were never wired in shipped 1.9.2)

Three knobs/UI features were exposed (config + `_VHOST_COERCE` + dashboard) but
their server-side consumers were missing — setting them was a silent no-op.
Auditing the test suite surfaced ~57 red specs for them; all now wired and green.

- **`RISK_OVERRIDES` (per-vhost risk-weight overrides) — now functional.**
  `protect()` activates the matched vhost's `RISK_OVERRIDES` dict (signal →
  weight) via a task-scoped `scoring._vhost_risk_ctx` ContextVar;
  `update_risk_and_maybe_ban()` prefers the override weight over the global
  `RISK_WEIGHTS` one (a `0` override suppresses the signal on that vhost). New
  `vhost._to_risk_overrides` coercer. Lets an operator tune signal sensitivity
  per hostname (e.g. silence `ua-non-browser` on an internal API vhost) with no
  rebuild. ContextVar is task-scoped, so concurrent vhosts never cross-talk.
- **`ALLOW_BYPASS_SECS` (operator-Allow grace window) — now functional.**
  When an admin clicks Allow/Unban, both `unban_endpoint` and
  `bulk_unban_endpoint` stamp `bypass_until = monotonic()+ALLOW_BYPASS_SECS` on
  the cleared identity (0 disables). `protect()` honours it: while in grace the
  heuristic detector pipeline is skipped (recorded `operator-allowed`) so a
  freshly-allowed visitor isn't instantly re-banned by residual signals.
  Operator-IP (`ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS`) traffic to non-admin paths is likewise
  never scored. `bypass_secs` exposed in `/metrics` clients + the unban
  response. Unban auth unified across GET+POST (the GET Allow path was
  reachable unauthenticated); both unban paths now reject a supplied-but-invalid
  `X-CSRF-Token` (defence-in-depth atop the SameSite cookie + admin-IP gate);
  `manual_unban` audit slog emitted.
- **Risk-breakdown control enrichment — server side now emitted.** The scoring
  endpoint returns `knob_state` (per-control `{on,kind,display}`, classified
  bool/num/list), `knob_page` (controls-vs-settings deep-link target), and
  `signal_meta` (`{weight,tier,desc}` per reason, covering synthetic reasons).
  `admin-ip-blocked` now resolves to its real control `ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS`;
  synthetic reasons (`chal-required`, `pow-required`, `admin-probe`,
  `operator-self`, `admin-ip-blocked`, `banned-silent`) gained descriptions.
  The dashboards already consumed these fields.

### Tests

- `tests/test_v192_iter11_ban_scope.py` — 24 tests (knob registration both
  registries, validator boundaries, dispatch ops arity/handlers/dual-write/
  golden, schema both backends + PG_SCHEMA_VERSION==2 + legacy-ip_bans
  invariant, `check_ip_ban_vhost` functional incl. expired + cross-vhost
  isolation, ban-logic wiring, global-default backward-compat; **iter-11b**:
  `risk_by_vhost` field + per-vhost `_eval_score`, risk-does-not-carry-across-
  vhosts, per-vhost detection still bans on its own crossing).
- Version-pinned sidebar-brand-ver tests rewritten to read `config.GW_VERSION`
  dynamically — never goes stale on a bump again.
- `test_import_postgres_dsn_applied` aligned with F14 redaction (asserts the
  masked DSN in `/config` state, not the raw secret).

### Validation

- Live E2E (2 vhosts, same IP): `BAN_SCOPE=vhost` → banned on `shop.test`
  (reason `ip-ban`), free on `api.test`; `global` default → vhost table
  ignored. Per-suite sweep green; Bandit High 0, Semgrep `p/python` 0/0, ruff
  blocking 0 new.

## [1.9.1] — 2026-06-06 — iter-10 internal pentest remediation

### Security fixes (closes 7 internal pentest findings)

- **LIVE-2 (HIGH)** — `POSTGRES_DSN` was returned in plaintext through
  `GET /secured/config`, defeating the iter-7 Fernet-at-rest migration.
  `_read_hot_reload_state()` now routes the value through a new
  `_redact_state_value()` that mirrors `db.cli_helpers.mask_dsn`, so
  the dashboard sees `postgresql://agw:****@host:5432/db` while the
  in-memory global stays raw for connection use.
- **LIVE-3 (MED)** — `POST /secured/config` (the all-knobs hot-reload
  endpoint) now requires `X-CSRF-Token`. Previously the endpoint was
  role-gated only; defence-in-depth pierced even though `SameSite=Strict`
  blocked classical cross-origin CSRF.
- **LIVE-4 (MED)** — `POST /secured/ban` now requires CSRF on non-safe
  methods. Closes the symmetric gap on the ban surface.
- **LIVE-5 (LOW)** — `_csrf_token_valid()` signature extended with
  `require_for_safe: bool = False` kwarg (non-breaking default). Fixes
  the `GET /secured/settings-export?include_secrets=1` TypeError 500 →
  now returns a valid ZIP when the CSRF token header is presented.
- **LIVE-1/6 (MED)** — `db_load_admin_ips` (and the OIDC user-
  provisioning path in `admin/oidc.py`) used SQLite-only
  `INSERT OR IGNORE`, so PG-only mode silently dropped persistence.
  Both sites now branch on `active_backend()` and emit
  `INSERT … ON CONFLICT … DO NOTHING` on PG.
- **LIVE-7 (LOW)** — Server-side `_strip_html_brackets()` neutralises
  raw `<`/`>` in operator free-text fields (`admin_ips.note`,
  `admin_ips.description`, `ban?reason=…`) before they hit the DB.
- **LIVE-8 (INFO)** — `/secured/ban?ip=…` now validates the IP via
  `ipaddress.ip_address()` and rejects non-IP strings with 400.

### Dependency bumps (CVE remediation)

- `aiohttp 3.13.5 → 3.14.0` to clear CVE-2026-34993 + CVE-2026-47265
  (both MEDIUM, fixed upstream in 3.14.0). All three image arches
  rebuilt; Trivy now reports 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM on every
  arch.

### Code quality

- B904 fix on `admin/auth.py`'s ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS boot guard
  (`raise SystemExit(2) from _e`).
- F401 cleanup on `admin/oidc.py` (unused `sqlite3` + `DB_PATH` imports
  obsolete after the backend-branched `open_conn()` path).

### Tests

- **`tests/test_v191_pentest_fixes.py`** — 17 new regression tests
  covering all seven LIVE findings, plus a forward-looking guard that
  fails CI if any new `INSERT OR …` SQLite-only DML lands outside the
  documented backend-branched whitelist.
- `GW-Tests-Full.md` catalogue updated: 6 previously-missing v19x
  sections added with per-file totals.

### Validation

See `validation/1.9.1.md` → **Re-validation — iter-10**.

---

## [1.9.1] — 2026-06-05

Post-1.9.0 hardening + documentation. No new features; security +
operator-facing polish.

### Security

- **CSV-injection fix** in `dashboards/siem.py` audit-events export.
  `_csv_safe()` prepends a single-quote on cells starting with formula
  chars (`=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `\t`, `\r`) so opening the export in
  Excel/LibreOffice/Numbers renders them as text instead of evaluating.
  Attacker who can write to `audit_events.detail` (via authenticated
  admin paths) could otherwise inject `=HYPERLINK(...)` that fires on
  operator download. Semgrep p/python now reports 0 findings.
- **Propagator hardening** — `_PROPAGATE_NEVER` no longer references
  `__path__` (proxy.py is a module, not a package — the dead-entries
  lint guard would have flagged it as a regression). Other dangerous
  builtins (open / exec / eval / globals / setattr / getattr / etc.)
  still gated.

### Documentation

- **MANUAL §18 "Postgres / single-DB mode"** — new operator-facing
  guide (~120 lines): backend auto-selection table, boot-guard exit
  codes (2/3/4), `POSTGRES_BOOT_MAX_ATTEMPTS` / `POSTGRES_BOOT_BACKOFF_S`
  / `OFFLINE_BG_TASKS` env vars, upgrade-banner + `.pg_migrated` marker
  semantics (including how to re-trigger the banner by deleting the
  marker), `db.import` / `db.export` CLI tools with arg examples + exit
  codes, `pg_schema_versions` operator query, downgrade procedure.
- **README** — 3 cross-reference rows added pointing to MANUAL §18.
- **GW-Tests-Full.md** — 11 new test-file entries (mine + iter-4 work).
  Totals updated: 156 → 167 files, ~7,114 → ~7,430 functions. Every
  section now carries the mandatory `**Total: N tests**` line.

### Tests

- 177 PG-migration QA tests pass on 1.9.1 (22 static + 155 dynamic).
- 38 live-PG E2E pass (with a PG container).
- 0 ruff findings in migration files, 0 bandit High/Medium on proxy.py,
  0 semgrep findings (after CSV-injection fix), 0 Trivy HIGH/CRITICAL
  on all 3 arches.

### Validation

- Multi-arch images rebuilt and pushed:
  - amd64 / arm64 / arm/v7 — Harbor tag `1.9.1`

### Iter-5 — dynamic DB-test fixes (rolled into the 1.9.1 push)

Live PG-mode round-trip on a real `agw-pg` + `agw-gw` rig surfaced 10
source defects the static suites missed:

- **UI-1** — `/secured/honeypots` returned 502. Dashboard file existed
  but route + module-import were missing. Added route entries to
  `proxy.py` and the `dashboards.honeypots` import to
  `dashboards/__init__.py`.
- **UI-2** — `chart.umd.min.js` + `purify.min.js` decoy-404'd
  unauthenticated, breaking chart rendering on the login page and any
  session-refresh window. Added both to `_ADMIN_PUBLIC_SUBPATHS`.
- **B1** — `db_test_endpoint` / `db_switch_endpoint` now propagate the
  candidate DSN to `db.postgres.POSTGRES_DSN` around the probe call —
  the probe reads its OWN module's globals, not the caller's.
- **B2** — `on_startup` reordered: `db_load_secrets()` runs BEFORE the
  `if POSTGRES_DSN_NOW:` PG-init block. After a `/__db-switch` restart,
  the env var is empty + the persisted DSN lives in `secrets_kv`; the
  prior ordering silently skipped A5 + `db_init_postgres` + F12
  boot-resume.
- **B3** — `_resume_pending_bg_migration` reads the F12 marker via
  direct `sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)`. `open_conn()` would route to PG
  once DSN is loaded, missing the marker that lives in SQLite.
- **B4** — `_runner()` clears the marker via direct SQLite DELETE
  (writer queue's `del_config` op routed to PG).
- **B5** — `db_switch_endpoint` writes `DB_BACKEND` to SQLite SYNC via
  direct `sqlite3` + `commit()` before `os._exit(0)`. The previous
  `asyncio.sleep(0.5)` raced the exit, leaving the post-restart
  gateway on the OLD backend.
- **B6** — F12 marker write also via direct SQLite for the same reason.
- **B7** — `admin/users.py:213` queued `user_session_create` with a
  7-tuple; M11's runtime arity guard caught it and refused the mirror
  write. Now an 8-tuple (trailing `csrf_nonce`).
- **Bonus** — `db_migration_status_endpoint`, `db_vacuum_history_endpoint`,
  `_vacuum_scheduler_loop`, `_DB_VACUUM_LOCK` re-added to
  `core/proxy_handler.py` (proxy.py route table referenced them).

#### Iter-5 QA additions

- `tests/test_v190_dyntest_fixes.py` — **17 tests** freezing every
  iter-5 fix (UI-1, UI-2, B1–B7, plus 4 endpoint-exists guards). All
  pass. Full release-cycle suite now **1144 pass / 0 fail**.

#### Iter-5 live verification

- `/secured/honeypots` → HTTP 200 (was 502)
- `/secured/honeypots-data` → HTTP 200, complete JSON shape
- `/assets/chart.umd.min.js` unauth → HTTP 200, 205 KB (was 404 decoy)
- `/assets/purify.min.js` unauth → HTTP 200, 25 KB (was 404 decoy)
- `/secured/service-data` → 60 history buckets, 23/34 non-zero fields,
  `pg_available:True`, `is_live:True`

### Validation (iter-5 re-tag of 1.9.1)

- Multi-arch images rebuilt and re-pushed under the 1.9.1 tag:
  - amd64 `sha256:d812fbf613584398537e60463d08d1283dbf04139a19f1af994aab5fc13bbcb4`
  - arm64 `sha256:a9f1f261e15e083a8a629d3e86ceb38247a1b9a5c17f1993422818ea8274516b`
  - arm/v7 `sha256:c01db3b7e639dcc0f3f99487a6dce93749f9ac3d6488c23e3a5fe5600f8ce7b7`
  - **manifest list** `sha256:009fd95a0351ef5c2651be45b1534a97ef32a39170b1b290922a9ab8b01756e7`
- 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH (Trivy, all 3 arches)
- 0 Bandit / Semgrep findings on iter-4/5 surface
- Ruff blocking (`F841/F401/S314/B904`): clean

---

## [1.9.0] — 2026-06-05 — Iteration 4 (same-version)

PG-only single-DB contract. Cumulative review-fix release across four
iterations against the 1.9.0 line. Source / Harbor tag held at 1.9.0 for
all iterations; this entry covers iteration-4's surface.

### Security

- **F11** — `db_switch_endpoint` audit row records `bg_scheduled`,
  `full_migrate_requested`, `cutoff_ts`. Durable forensic anchor for the
  historical-events copy (slog stream is lost on `os._exit(0)`).
- **F12** — historical `_full_migrate_background` migration deferred to
  the post-restart boot hook (`proxy._resume_pending_bg_migration`). Removes
  the race where the executor was killed mid-COPY by the 1-second
  `os._exit(0)`. Handler now persists a `pending_bg_migration` config_kv
  marker; on_startup claims via `_try_claim_bg_migration` and clears the
  marker after the COPY completes.
- **F13** — `_role_denied` and `_require_csrf` return only
  `{"error":"forbidden"}`; forensic detail (role, required-roles, path,
  actor) goes to slog. Closes the info-leak that let a low-privilege user
  enumerate the authorization model.
- **F14** — `POSTGRES_DSN` persisted to `secrets_kv` (never returned by
  `GET /__config`) and wrapped in Fernet keyed off a domain-separated
  derive of `SESSION_KEY` (`enc:v1:` prefix). Legacy plaintext rows
  decrypt as-is until the next `/__db-switch` re-persists ciphertext.
- **F15** — `POSTGRES_DSN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` operator-hardening callout in
  `validation/1.9.0.md`; F2 URL/probe validation still applies when unset.
- **A5** — `check_pg_schema_version()` runs BEFORE `db_init_postgres` at
  boot, reads `MAX(pg_schema_versions.version)`, refuses to start when
  `abs(diff) > 1` major version. Pure read; no DB mutation.
- **M10** — `_pg_mirror_kv` documents the `InFailedSqlTransaction` cascade
  contract for callers passing `_conn=`.
- **TC1** — runtime guard rejects `_conn=` with `autocommit=True` at the
  dispatch boundary; prevents silent loss of M6 transaction semantics.

### Architecture

- **A4** — `_pg_dispatch_op` refactored from a 365-line if/elif ladder
  into a registry pattern (`_PG_OP_HANDLERS` dict, 40 entries × tiny
  `_h_<op>(cur, args)` handler functions). Lifted `_USER_MUTABLE` and
  `_GW_MUTABLE` whitelists to module-level frozensets. New dispatcher is
  ~30 lines: arity check → registry lookup → call. **Zero SQL drift** —
  verified by the golden-SQL harness.
- **Golden-SQL harness** — `tests/test_pg_dispatch_sql_golden.py` +
  `tests/golden/pg_dispatch_sql.json` (40 ops frozen). Captures every
  `cur.execute / executemany` per op via a capturing cursor; diffs vs
  the checked-in golden. Catches accidental SQL changes (including
  refactor regressions) at PR time.
- **L8** — `db/cli_helpers.py:mask_dsn` shared by `db.export` and
  `db.import` (was two duplicate `_mask_dsn` impls).
- **L10** — `_PgCursorWrapper.execute()` and `_PgConnWrapper.execute()`
  carry symmetric L10 return-contract docstrings; both produce
  fetchone-able cursor objects.
- **L11-strengthen** — when `proxy.py` is loaded via symlink
  (lex_dir != real_dir), `_PROJECT_ROOTS` must contain BOTH directories
  — test enforces it; skips on non-symlink installs.

### Hygiene

- **M9** — removed unused `Callable, Iterable` imports from `db/import.py`.
- **L9** — hoisted `import os as _os_pg` out of `on_startup`; reuses
  module-level `_os_proxy`.
- **TC3** — new AST-based unused-imports lint covers `db/export.py`,
  `db/import.py`, `db/cli_helpers.py`.
- Ruff hygiene — `B904` `from None` on the M11 arity check; unused
  `InvalidToken` import dropped from `db/sqlite.py`.

### Tests

- `tests/test_v190_iteration4_fixes.py` — 34 tests for F11/F12/F13/F14/F15
  + L10/TC1/TC3 + A4 + A5 (registry + decision-matrix coverage).
- `tests/test_pg_dispatch_sql_golden.py` — 5 tests; locks SQL+params for
  every op against `tests/golden/pg_dispatch_sql.json` (40 ops captured).
- Updated F10 tests for the post-F12 contract (executor moved to boot).

### Validation

108 release-cycle tests pass (iter-4 + iter-3 + iter-1 + 1.8.15). 145
v14/v142/v173/control_regression tests pass. Bandit clean on `proxy.py`
and `db/postgres.py`. Semgrep `p/python` 0/0 on the iter-4 surface. Ruff
blocking categories (`F841, F401, S314, B904`) clean across all touched
modules. Golden-SQL harness confirms zero dispatch drift for the A4
registry refactor.

---

## [1.8.15] — 2026-06-04

Cumulative release of the iter-15 through iter-22 work performed on the 1.8.14 line. Source carried `GW_VERSION = AntiBotWaf_GW_1.8.15` partway through; Harbor tag bumped to match.

### Performance

- **SQLite tuning** — single `_sqlite_connect()` helper consolidates all 12 connect sites with WAL + `synchronous=NORMAL` + `wal_autocheckpoint=10000` + `temp_store=MEMORY` + `mmap_size=256MB`. Cuts INSERT+COMMIT on slow-fsync disks (pt4.tech root cause).
- **Quick-wins #2–#8/#11/#12** — `json.dumps` outside `state_lock`, JA4H short-circuit + lock-free write, decay skip when score is 0, LLM heuristic skips static assets, per-request `_vhost` cache, conditional LRU promotion (`_should_promote()`), per-request `_ua_of()` cache (38 callsites), `_is_static_asset_path()` single source.

### Resilience

- **Postgres auth-failure resilience** (iter-17 → iter-19). GW never blocks on Postgres being down or rejecting credentials: `_is_pg_auth_failure()` detector + `_pg_auth_failure_hint()` (placeholder-pwd) + `_disable_postgres_for_process()` flips `_postgres_available=False` and reverts `DB_BACKEND` to sqlite. Service dashboard banner surfaces the `ALTER USER` recovery command. `_postgres_load_module()` honest (install-state only).
- **Upstream timeout knobs** — `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_SECS=10`, `UPSTREAM_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS=3`; per-vhost + Thresholds card.
- **Circuit-breaker knobs** — `CIRCUIT_FAIL_THRESHOLD/OPEN_SECS/HALF_OPEN_MAX` hot-reload + per-vhost.

### Operator UX

- **`ALLOWED_METHODS` default widened** to `GET,HEAD,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE,OPTIONS` so REST APIs work out of the box. Tighten via env or per-vhost.
- **Per-vhost `ALLOWED_METHODS` now actually applied** — runtime checks read via `vc("ALLOWED_METHODS")` instead of the bare module global (was silent contract violation since iter-X).
- **Operator Allow grace window** — `ALLOW_BYPASS_SECS=300` + `IpState.bypass_until`; admin Allow grants scoring bypass for the window.
- **BLOCK_RESPONSE_MODE knob** — `"homepage"` (default) vs `"404"` decoy response.
- **Identity-popover Unban** — Unban button added to Identity popover in both `main.html` and `agents.html`.
- **Suspicious + Live Feed + Clients filter bars** — IP/UA/Domain search + sortable columns + UPSTREAM DOWN pulse pill.
- **Domain column persistence (iter-21)** — `last_vhost` now persisted in `clients` table; survives GW restart instead of resetting to "—".

### Security review fix (iter-22)

- **F-1: `last_vhost` length cap** — capped at 120 chars (matches `last_path` / `last_user_agent`). Attacker-supplied Host headers up to 8 KiB would otherwise persist into memory + disk + dashboard JSON. CWE-400 mitigation.

### Tests

- 152 → 153 test files. ~100+ new QA tests across `test_v1815_*` family.

---

## [1.8.14 iter-20] — 2026-06-03

### Changed

- **Default `ALLOWED_METHODS` widened to include REST verbs** (`core/proxy_handler.py`). The original F3 hardening set the default to `GET,HEAD,POST,OPTIONS`, which silent-decoyed PATCH/PUT/DELETE — breaking every REST-API upstream out of the box. Default is now `GET,HEAD,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE,OPTIONS`. Operators who proxy a static-only site can tighten via env (`ALLOWED_METHODS=GET,HEAD,POST,OPTIONS`). Risk-side controls (rate-limit, score, ban) are unchanged — they already cover all methods.

---

## [1.8.14 iter-19] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **`_postgres_load_module()` no longer reports library availability as runtime state** (`db/postgres.py`). iter-18's `if _PG_AUTH_FAILED: return None` made the dashboard's "Switch backend → Postgres" path emit the misleading `psycopg not installed in this image` (psycopg WAS installed; only the auth-failure flag was set). iter-19 reverts the loader to honest install-state reporting. Runtime suppression of post-failure connect attempts stays at the connect layer: `_PgPool._connect()` short-circuits on `_PG_AUTH_FAILED`, and the global `_postgres_available=False` flip keeps record()/sampler/svc-metrics/readers on the SQLite path.

### Tests

- Updated `test_postgres_load_module_reports_install_only` to assert the function reports install state ONLY (not runtime state). 14/14 QA suite green.

---

## [1.8.14 iter-18] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **Gateway auto-reverts to SQLite if Postgres can't connect at startup** (`db/postgres.py`). User report: even with iter-17's auth-failure short-circuit, the gateway still left `_postgres_available=True` and `DB_BACKEND=postgres` after a non-auth init failure — the svc-metrics sampler (5 s) and every event-write kept re-opening doomed connections, filling the TimescaleDB log with `password authentication failed` lines indefinitely. Now:
  - `_disable_postgres_for_process(reason)` helper flips `_postgres_available=False` across every sys.modules-loaded module AND coerces `DB_BACKEND` back to `"sqlite"` on `core.proxy_handler`. Idempotent; reset only by process restart.
  - Called from BOTH branches: auth-failure (immediate short-circuit) and generic-failure giveup (after the 12-attempt × backoff window). Either way, the gateway transitions cleanly to SQLite for the remainder of the process.
  - `_postgres_load_module()` now returns `None` when `_PG_AUTH_FAILED` is set — every ad-hoc `pg.connect()` caller (12 sites) already guards on `if pg is None: skip`, so a single check at the module loader cascades through the whole module.
  - `_PgPool._connect()` refuses to attempt new connections after auth failure with a clear `RuntimeError`.
  - New `[db-pg] active backend auto-reverted to SQLite` warning log makes the transition visible.

### Tests

- **3 new QA tests** in `test_v1815_pg_auth_resilience_qa.py` (total 14): `_disable_postgres_for_process` helper, `_postgres_load_module` short-circuit, `_PgPool._connect` gate.

---

## [1.8.14 iter-17] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **Gateway must never fail to start when Postgres is down or has auth issues** (`db/postgres.py`, `dashboards/service_metrics.py`, `dashboards/service.html`). Previously `db_init_postgres` burned the full 12-attempt × backoff window on a wrong-password retry that would never recover (a classic Postgres-volume-vs-compose-password drift looks identical to "Postgres is down" but is unrecoverable from a retry). The gateway is also at risk of looking "stuck" during this window. Now:
  - `_is_pg_auth_failure()` detects auth signatures (`password authentication failed`, `no password supplied`, `no pg_hba.conf entry`, `ident authentication failed`, `InvalidPassword`, `InvalidAuthorizationSpecification`) and the retry loop short-circuits immediately.
  - One actionable log line emitted with the exact `ALTER USER <user> WITH PASSWORD '<value-from-docker-compose-or-DSN>';` recovery command. Password never logged verbatim — only the placeholder.
  - New `_PG_AUTH_FAILED` / `_PG_AUTH_FAILED_TS` / `_PG_AUTH_FAILED_HINT` module-level state surfaced via `/secured/service-data` → rendered as a red banner at the top of the Service dashboard with the recovery command. Banner uses `textContent` (XSS-safe).
  - `db_init_postgres` returns `False` on auth failure — never raises — so `on_startup` proceeds with the SQLite backend. Gateway stays UP.

### Tests

- **11 new QA tests** in `test_v1815_pg_auth_resilience_qa.py` covering: detector signatures, hint actionability + password-leak safety, retry short-circuit, `False`-not-raise contract, `on_startup` non-fatal handling, service-data surface, banner DOM safety, default-hidden state.

### Validation

- See `validation/1.8.14.md § Iter-17` for full per-stage table + R5 STRIDE register entry (banner XSS surface — controlled via `textContent`, not `innerHTML`).

---

## [1.8.14 iter-16] — 2026-06-03

### Added

- **BLOCK_RESPONSE_MODE knob** (`config.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`): controls decoy response mode — `"homepage"` (default, returns vhost `/`) or `"404"` (static 404). Per-vhost override; hot-reload.
- **Operator Allow grace window** (`ALLOW_BYPASS_SECS=300`, `state.py::IpState.bypass_until`): admin Allow grants a 5-minute scoring bypass; `protect()` records `reason="operator-allowed"` and short-circuits.
- **Upstream timeout knobs** (`UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_SECS=10`, `UPSTREAM_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS=3`): hot-reload + per-vhost; surfaces in Thresholds card.
- **Circuit-breaker knobs** (`CIRCUIT_FAIL_THRESHOLD`, `CIRCUIT_OPEN_SECS`, `CIRCUIT_HALF_OPEN_MAX`): hot-reload + per-vhost; surfaces in Thresholds card.
- **Identity-popover Unban** (`dashboards/main.html`, `dashboards/agents.html`): Unban button added to Identity popover (was only on Risk breakdown).
- **Suspicious + Live Feed + Clients filter bars**: IP/UA/Domain search inputs + sortable columns + UPSTREAM DOWN pulse pill.

### Fixed

- **pt4.tech slowness** — SQLite 802 MB DB on slow-fsync disk (57 ms/4 KB) caused 76 ms `INSERT+COMMIT`. New `db/sqlite.py::_sqlite_connect()` helper consolidates all 12 `sqlite3.connect()` call sites with `WAL + synchronous=NORMAL + wal_autocheckpoint=10000 + temp_store=MEMORY + mmap_size=256MB + cache_size=-20000`.
- **Self-ban banner text**: distinguishes admin IP with session vs without.
- **colspan=13 → 14** in `agents.html` (Suspicious table: 12 data + expand + bulk-chk).
- **`_migPollTimer` leak**: pushed to `_timers` array + cleared in `beforeunload`.
- **dead `import re`** in `helpers.py` (ruff F401 cleanup).

### Performance

- **Quick-wins #2–#8, #11, #12**: `json.dumps` moved outside `state_lock`; JA4H short-circuit + lock-free write; risk-decay skip when `risk_score == 0`; LLM heuristic skips static assets (`_is_static_asset_path()`); per-request `_vhost` cache; conditional LRU promotion via `_should_promote()` (50 % threshold); per-request `_ua_of(request)` cache (38 callsites).

### Tests

- **89 new QA tests** across 6 files (`test_v1815_{block_response_mode,vhost_policy_summary,allow_bypass,sqlite_tuning,id_popover_unban,perf_quick_wins}_qa.py`) + `test_v1814_admin_bypass_qa.py`. 18 prior 1.8.14/1.8.15 test files added to `GW-Tests-Full.md` (comm gap closed).

### Validation

- Stage 9 ruff blocking categories: 0 (F841/F401/S314/B904 all 0 after `import re` removal). Bandit `-ll`: 0 H/C. Semgrep `p/python`: 0 findings. Trivy ×3 arches: 0 CRITICAL/HIGH each. DAST: 24/25 (1 known by-design — `/live` 404 loopback-only).
- Multi-arch manifest pushed to the release registry (`<registry>/antibotappsecgw:1.8.14`) → `sha256:1d205dd2d2a67093dfaa9d15d395e7b16650e3c8381a3ef8cd8905d461fbb7e2` (amd64+arm64+armv7).

## [1.8.14] — 2026-05-25

### Security

- **T0-1 — Session absolute timeout** (`admin/users.py`, `config.py`): added `SESSION_ABSOLUTE_TIMEOUT` knob (default 8 h). `_session_verify` now checks `created_ts + SESSION_ABSOLUTE_TIMEOUT` against the current time; sessions that exceed the hard cap are rejected even when the sliding idle timeout has not expired. `created_ts` is persisted in `user_sessions` (already a DB column) and restored into `_SESSION_CACHE` on startup, so the cap survives process restarts.
- **T0-2 — Per-session random CSRF nonce** (`admin/users.py`, `admin/auth.py`, `db/sqlite.py`): the CSRF token was previously derived as `HMAC(SESSION_KEY, sid)[:32]`, meaning key rotation (`/__rotate-keys`) silently invalidated every live session's CSRF protection. Each session now receives a `secrets.token_hex(16)` nonce at creation time, stored in `user_sessions.csrf_nonce` (new column, migration added). `_csrf_token_valid` reads the nonce from `_SESSION_CACHE`; pre-migration sessions without a stored nonce fall back to the HMAC derivation. `login_submit_endpoint` and `totp_verify_endpoint` updated to set the `agw_csrf` cookie from the stored nonce.
- **T0-4 — OIDC state dict cap** (`admin/oidc.py`): `_OIDC_STATE` was unbounded — an automated login flood could grow it to exhaust memory. Added `_OIDC_STATE_MAX = 500`; `oidc_login_endpoint` purges expired states on each call and returns HTTP 503 `Retry-After: 30` when the cap is reached.
- **T2-5 — eTLD+1 origin validation** (`core/proxy_handler.py`): `_origin_check_failed` previously used exact hostname matching (`host not in ALLOWED_HOSTS`), requiring operators to enumerate every subdomain. Changed to subdomain-aware check: `host.endswith("." + allowed_host)` is also accepted, so `sub.example.com` is allowed when `example.com` is in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

### Added

- **T1-1 — Upstream response latency tracking** (`core/proxy_handler.py`): rolling 500-sample deque `_upstream_latency_samples` records end-to-end upstream round-trip time (connection → last body byte). `/__metrics` now includes `upstream_latency: {p50_ms, p95_ms, sample_n, warn, warn_threshold_ms}`. New `UPSTREAM_LATENCY_WARN_MS` knob (default 2000 ms) triggers `warn: true` when p95 exceeds the threshold. No impact on the request path; append is O(1).
- **T1-3 — Webhook delivery health counters** (`integrations/webhook.py`): `_WEBHOOK_LAST_SUCCESS_TS` and `_WEBHOOK_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` counters added. Updated on every delivery outcome in `_webhook_worker`. Exposed in `/__metrics` under `services.webhook: {configured, last_success_ts, consecutive_failures, circuit_open}` alongside the existing circuit-breaker state.
- **T3-2 — Bulk unban UI** (`dashboards/agents.html`): checkbox column appears for banned rows; "Bulk actions" bar floats in when ≥ 1 box is checked. "Unban selected" calls `POST /secured/unban` per selected identity. "Select all" header checkbox and cancel button included.
- **T3-3 — Ban → Logs drill-down** (`dashboards/agents.html`, `dashboards/main.html`): "View requests →" button added to the ban modal header. Click pre-populates `appsecgw.logs.prefs.v1` in `sessionStorage` with the banned IP as the `q` filter, then navigates to the Logs page — one-click pivot from ban to request history.

### Configuration / Export — Full-backup surface (2026-05-29)

- **F1 — Export now covers the full operator-curated surface** (`admin/settings.py`): prior to 1.8.14 the XML captured only `<knobs>`, `<admin_ips>`, and `<vhosts>`; a backup → reset → restore cycle silently dropped every operator-managed table. The exporter now emits eight additional sections: `<siem_alert_rules>`, `<dlp_patterns>`, `<signal_orders>` (LOCAL gw only — foreign gw_ids are meaningless on a restored instance), `<honey_fingerprints>` (most-recent 1000 to keep the archive under 1 MiB), `<gw_registry>`, `<gw_distribution>`, `<users>` (metadata only without `include_secrets`), and `<secrets>` (always-empty container without `include_secrets`). Each section is wrapped in an independent try/except so a missing table on a freshly-created DB cannot abort the whole export.
- **F2 — `include_secrets` checkbox now honest** (`admin/settings.py`, `dashboards/settings.html`): `settings_export_endpoint` previously did `del include_secrets` at the top of `_settings_build_xml` and always forced it to `False`, so the operator-facing checkbox in the Settings dashboard was a lie. The endpoint now reads `?include_secrets=1` from the query string and threads it through; when set, the archive additionally serialises the `secrets_kv` plaintext, every `users.password_hash`, and the LOCAL gw row's HMAC `private_key`. Filename is suffixed `-with-secrets` and the UI tooltip + label updated to reflect what the box actually does. `slog`'s `config_exported` event records the `include_secrets` flag for auditability.
- **F3 — Importer extended to restore every new section** (`admin/settings.py`): seven new dispatch arms applied directly to SQLite (atomic per row); summary JSON now reports `siem_rules_added`, `dlp_patterns_added`, `signal_orders_restored`, `honey_fps_restored`, `gw_registry_restored`, `gw_distribution_restored`, `users_restored`, and `secrets_restored` alongside the existing knob/admin-ip/vhost counters. Safe-by-default behaviour preserved: `users` uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` (an existing admin is never silently overwritten), `gw_registry` UPSERT `COALESCE`s the existing `private_key` so the live mesh secret is never clobbered, dedup keys for SIEM/DLP avoid duplicate rows on repeat-imports, and `signal_orders` are tied to the LOCAL `gw_id` regardless of what the archive carried.
- **F4 — Two env-only knobs promoted to hot-reload**: `JA4H_DENY_LIST` and `ABUSEIPDB_CACHE_HOURS` are now in `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS`, so they ride the standard export lane and survive a restore. `JA4H_DENY_LIST`'s default type changed from `frozenset` to `set` in `config.py` so `_read_hot_reload_state`'s `isinstance(v, set)` branch picks it up consistently with the sibling `JA4_DENY_LIST`.

### Tests (2026-05-29)

- `tests/test_v1814_full_export_scope.py` — 12 tests covering the new export contract: endpoint honours `include_secrets`, no silent `del` of the param, all eleven sections emitted, summary counters present, LOCAL `private_key` protected on import, `users` uses `INSERT OR IGNORE`, integration probe against a fixture SQLite DB verifying that `include_secrets=False` strips password hashes / private keys / `secrets_kv` while `include_secrets=True` includes them, missing tables degrade gracefully, and both newly-promoted knobs are present in `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS`. `tests/test_critical.py::test_165` extended with test values for the two new knobs.
- `tests/test_v1814_full_export_qa.py` — 12 QA regression guards for edge cases / invariants / UX traps the contract tests don't cover: `honey_fingerprints` 1000-row cap and most-recent ordering, `signal_orders` filtered to LOCAL `gw_id` (foreign gw rows stripped), peer `gw_registry` rows NEVER carry a `private_key` even with `include_secrets=True`, filename `-with-secrets` suffix only when secrets are honoured, `slog` records `include_secrets` flag for audit trail, the `settings.html` JS wires the checkbox into `?include_secrets=1`, `JA4H_DENY_LIST` default type is `set` not `frozenset`, repeated exports against the same DB produce identical section topology, unrecognised `?include_secrets=` values default to OFF (explicit truthy allow-list, no truthiness coercion), missing DB tables emit empty containers with no secret leakage, the importer wraps each new section in its own try/except so one bad row doesn't abort the rest, and both promoted knobs are wired as 2-tuples `(parser, validator)` in `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS`.

### Security (post-release bypass hardening — 2026-05-27)

- **B-04 — `agw_lc` lifecycle cookie HMAC** (`detection/cookie_lifecycle.py`): the `agw_lc` cookie was set to the static value `"1"`, allowing trivial static replay. Replaced with an HMAC-SHA256 token (`_make_lc_token(ip_tier)`) — 16-char hex, bound to the client's IP /24 tier and a 1-hour rolling window. `_verify_lc_token` accepts current and previous window (clock-skew tolerance). Static replay (`agw_lc=1`) now fails lifecycle verification.
- **B-08 — Per-identity ghost-detection threshold jitter** (`state.py`): `IpState.cookie_ghost_threshold_jitter = random.randint(0, 2)` added at identity creation. `cookie_ghost_check` applies the jitter to both `COOKIE_GHOST_MIN_REQUESTS` and `COOKIE_GHOST_MISS_THRESHOLD`, making the exact request count at which ghost detection fires unpredictable per identity.
- **B-01 — `sec-fetch-nav-absent` signal** (`config.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`): Chrome/Edge `GET` requests with `text/html` in `Accept` but no `Sec-Fetch-Mode` header now score +20. Gated on `HEADER_COMPLETENESS_ENABLED`. Mitigates curl-impersonate and Playwright spoofing that omit Fetch metadata. Added to `SIGNAL_KNOB`, `SIGNAL_KNOB_JS`, `_REASON_METHOD`, `SIGNAL_LATENCY_HINTS`, `SIGNAL_LABELS`, and scoring endpoint `DESCRIPTIONS`.

### Tests

- `tests/test_v1814_security_hardening.py` — 30 new tests covering all T0/T1/T2/T3 changes: absolute timeout enforcement, CSRF nonce randomness and cache lookup, OIDC state cap, latency tracking structure, webhook health counters, eTLD+1 origin rules, and UI element presence for bulk unban and drill-down link.
- `tests/test_v1814_bypass_hardening.py` — 21 new tests: HMAC lifecycle token (make/verify, static replay, wrong IP tier, window rollover), lifecycle script injection, per-identity ghost-threshold jitter (range, variance, effect on check timing), `sec-fetch-nav-absent` in RISK_WEIGHTS/SIGNAL_KNOB/SIGNAL_KNOB_JS.

### Added (post-bypass-hardening)

- **`PRESERVE_HOST` knob** (`config.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`, `vhost.py`): new bool knob (default `False`) that — when enabled — forwards the client's original `Host`, `Origin`, and `Referer` headers to the upstream unchanged. Default `False` keeps the existing behaviour where the proxy rewrites these headers to the upstream's netloc (needed for TLS SNI and CORS on origin-strict backends). Enable only when the upstream routes by the public hostname (CDN-style, multi-tenant apps expecting the client hostname). Per-vhost configurable via `vhost_set` + `vc('PRESERVE_HOST')`; stored in `vhosts.json`; hot-reloadable via the Controls dashboard. `X-Forwarded-Host` is always set regardless of this knob (informational header for upstream). Registered in `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS`, `_VHOST_COERCE`, and `dashboards/vhost_policy.html KNOB_META`.

### Tests (post-bypass-hardening)

- `tests/test_v1814_signal_knob_hotreload_qa.py` — 19 tests: membership + parser, config default, `SIGNAL_KNOB` mapping, source-code gate presence and gate-off logic for all 5 new `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS` entries (`FEODO_ENABLED`, `CINS_ENABLED`, `URLHAUS_ENABLED`, `H2_SETTINGS_FP_ENABLED`, `JS_CONSISTENCY_ENABLED`).
- `tests/test_v1814_preserve_host_qa.py` — 17 tests: `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS` registration + `_to_bool` parser, `config.PRESERVE_HOST` default, `_VHOST_COERCE` entry with string/bool coerce, HTTP path gate (`upstream_host and not vc('PRESERVE_HOST')`), WebSocket path gate + origin/referer guards, `X-Forwarded-Host` always-before-gate, per-vhost accept/persist/read-back.

### Fixed (pre-existing, found during bypass hardening pipeline run)

- **5 SIGNAL_KNOB knobs missing from `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS`** (`core/proxy_handler.py`): `FEODO_ENABLED`, `CINS_ENABLED`, `URLHAUS_ENABLED`, `H2_SETTINGS_FP_ENABLED`, `JS_CONSISTENCY_ENABLED` were in SIGNAL_KNOB (so the controls dashboard rendered toggle links for them) but not in `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS` (so those links would 400 when clicked). Added all five as `(_to_bool, None)` entries. Discovered by `test_v1813_control_toggles::test_signal_knob_toggles_are_settable`.

### Added (iteration 7 — Settings/Infrastructure dashboard)

- **`PRESERVE_HOST` in Settings → Infrastructure** (`dashboards/settings.html`): `PRESERVE_HOST` bool knob added to `INFRA_KNOBS` array so it renders as a live toggle in the Settings → Infrastructure card alongside `ALLOW_PRIVATE_UPSTREAM` and `STRICT_VHOST`. Description includes when to enable and the default-off rationale.

### Fixed (found during PRESERVE_HOST iteration 6 pipeline run)

- **`PRESERVE_HOST` missing from `vhost_policy.html` KNOB_META** (`dashboards/vhost_policy.html`): `PRESERVE_HOST` was registered in `_VHOST_COERCE` but absent from the `KNOB_META` JS object in `vhost_policy.html`, causing the Controls dashboard to render it as a generic text input instead of a bool toggle, and silently accepting string `"true"`/`"false"` from the UI instead of coercing to bool. Added `PRESERVE_HOST: {g:'Origin / Headers', t:'bool'}` entry. Caught by `test_pure.py::test_vhost_policy_html_knob_meta_coverage`.

### Fixed (iteration 8 — export/backup completeness + change-password modal)

- **Settings export/import missing vhost configs** (`admin/settings.py`): the `/__settings-export` ZIP contained all `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS` and admin IPs but omitted per-vhost policy overrides stored in `/data/vhosts.json`. A backup/restore cycle would silently drop all vhost-specific knob overrides. Fixed: `_settings_build_xml()` now serialises `vhost_list()` into a `<vhosts>` XML section; `settings_import_endpoint` restores each vhost entry via `vhost_set()` on import, and the JSON summary now includes `vhosts_restored`. The Settings → Export/Import UI cards updated to mention vhost coverage.
- **Change-password modal missing current-password field** (`dashboards/settings.html`): `changeUserPassword()` in the Settings → Users admin panel had no "Current password" input and sent only `{ password: newPw }` to `PATCH /secured/admin/users/{username}`. The backend requires `current_password` when `is_self=True` (caller == target), so an admin changing their own password via the user table received a 400 error. Fixed: added `id="u-pw-cur"` field with `type="password"` and label "Current password"; the submit handler conditionally includes `body.current_password = curPw` only when the field is non-empty (`if (curPw)`), preserving the admin-changes-other-user flow (no current password required).

### Tests (iteration 8)

- `tests/test_settings_config_functional.py` — `TestSettingsVhostExportImport` class (5 new tests): export XML contains `<vhosts>` element; import with `<vhosts>` entry increments `vhosts_restored`; full roundtrip (add vhost → export → verify hostname in XML → re-import → `vhosts_restored ≥ 1`); missing-hostname entry silently skipped; old export without `<vhosts>` imports cleanly (backward compat).
- `tests/test_v1814_change_password_qa.py` — **16 new tests** covering the full change-password flow: `TestChangePasswordUI` (8 source-code tests on `changeUserPassword()` modal HTML/JS — `u-pw-cur` input, type=password, label, value read, conditional body assignment, new/confirm fields, mismatch and min-length validation) and `TestChangePasswordEndpoint` (8 functional tests — self without current_password → 400, wrong current_password → 403, correct current_password → 200, admin changing other user → 200, viewer self without current_password → 400, viewer changing other user → 403, unauthenticated decoy, weak new password → 400).

### Fixed (iteration 9 — credentials dedup + env-pinned UX)

- **`POSTGRES_DSN` duplicate save surface** (`dashboards/settings.html`): the
  PostgreSQL DSN was rendered both in the **Database backend** card (structured
  host/port/user/pass form with mig-status and test-roundtrip) and in the
  **Integration credentials** card (raw DSN text input with a "Save credentials"
  button). Both wrote to the same `/secured/secrets` endpoint, but a Save in the
  cred form would silently lose the password (the form posts `••••••` rendered
  back) and made the authoritative surface ambiguous. Removed `POSTGRES_DSN`
  from the `CREDS` array — it is now managed solely in the Database backend
  card. The DSN reference left in the Database backend section is just a
  status/requirement note.
- **`env`-pinned credentials editable + Save misleading** (`dashboards/settings.html`):
  when a cred's source was `env` (env-var-pinned), the input was still editable
  and Save still POSTed to `/secured/secrets`. The runtime config writer rejects
  config_kv stomps on secret keys (per `db_load_config`'s `_SECRET_KEYS` guard),
  so the save was a misleading no-op — the env value still won on next reload.
  Fixed: when `source==='env'` the input is rendered with `disabled` + a clear
  "Set via env var — immutable from the UI" hint, the Clear button is hidden
  (nothing in `secrets_kv` to clear), and `btn-creds-save` skips disabled
  fields. Guard added: `test_v185_settings_migration::test_env_pinned_credential_inputs_are_disabled`.
- Tests updated: `test_creds_list_has_seven_keys` → `test_creds_list_has_six_keys`
  (POSTGRES_DSN moved); `test_creds_includes_expected_keys` no longer expects
  POSTGRES_DSN; new `test_creds_excludes_postgres_dsn` guard codifies the
  separation. Whole settings suite green.
- `tests/test_v1814_creds_dedup_qa.py` — **14 new tests**: DB backend card has structured postgres form; save handler POSTs to `/secrets`; `POSTGRES_DSN` absent from `CREDS` array; `CREDS` contains exactly 6 keys; creds card mentions DSN lives in DB card; `loadCreds()` detects `env` source; env-pinned input `disabled` + tooltip + hint; env-pinned hides Clear; save skips disabled fields; no-values message mentions env-pinned; controls HTML doesn't render `POSTGRES_DSN` input; creds card cannot resurrect env-only secrets.

### Fixed (iteration 10 — day-theme hardcoded dark backgrounds)

- **Three elements broke in the day (light) theme** (`dashboards/settings.html`): the "Test" button (`id="_tip-pg-test"`), the "Load DSN" button (`id="_tip-pg-load"`) in the database tip popup, and the "not set" badge in the integration credentials section all used `background:#21262d` (the dark-theme `--bg-elevated` value) hardcoded in JavaScript template literals. Because these strings are injected into the DOM dynamically — the DB popup on demand, the creds list on every `loadCreds()` call — the `_dp` theme-toggle palette scan (which runs once on existing `[style]` elements) never replaces them. In the light theme they rendered as black boxes. Fixed: all three now use `background:var(--bg-elevated)`, which the browser resolves to `#21262d` (dark) or `#eaeef2` (light) per the active `data-theme` attribute.

### Fixed (iteration 10 — ban-outcome breakdown card clarity)

- **`banned-silent` signal misrepresented in risk breakdown** (`dashboards/main.html`): Three operator-confusion issues fixed.
  1. `RISK_BAN_THRESHOLD` rendered as a numeric-cost control knob in the breakdown table (looked like the signal cost 500 pts). Fixed: outcome signals (`banned-silent`, `fp-banned`) detected via a new `_BAN_OUTCOME_SIGNALS` Set; their control column now renders an "outcome" badge (grey, `var(--dim)`) with a `≥N` threshold prefix and a tooltip explaining "adds 0 risk; request was silently served a decoy" and link title clarifying it is a threshold, not a cost.
  2. When ban had already expired (`banned_secs === 0`), no header appeared — operator saw live risk 0.0 and `banned-silent` events with no context. Fixed: new `gw-expired-ban` yellow-warning block shown when `outcomeHits > 0 && !(d.banned_secs > 0)`; explains the ban has elapsed, how many requests were served a decoy, and offers "View requests →" plus RISK_BAN_THRESHOLD re-ban guidance.
  3. Active-ban header read "likely tripped banned-silent" — circular because `banned-silent` was `breakdown[0]`. Fixed: `topRsnEntry` uses `breakdown.find()` skipping `_BAN_OUTCOME_SIGNALS`; falls back to empty string if no non-outcome signal found; "likely tripped" wording removed (now just "tripped").
  - **New CSS**: `.gw-expired-ban` (yellow warning block), `.gw-expired-ban-line` (yellow bold header), `.gw-outcome-label` (dim uppercase outcome badge).

### Fixed (iteration 10 — operator false-positive ban on upstream browsing)

- **Admin-authenticated users were being banned by their own proxy** (`core/proxy_handler.py`, `core/metrics.py`): when an operator browsed the protected upstream while logged into the gateway admin panel, each page load fired 10-30 sub-requests (HTML + CSS + JS + images), each scored independently. Heuristic signals (`session-churn` 75 pts, `ai-headers-incomplete` 10 pts × N, `header-order-fp` 8 pts × N) accumulated fast enough to trip `RISK_BAN_THRESHOLD` within 3-4 page loads. Root cause: `ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS` only gated dashboard access — upstream traffic from admin IPs was scored identically to regular visitors; no session-based bypass existed.
  - **Fix**: added `_admin_authed_bypass` flag — True when the request comes from an `ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS` address AND carries a valid `agw_session` cookie. When set:
    1. Per-identity and fingerprint ban checks are skipped (admin cannot be decoy'd while authenticated).
    2. All heuristic scoring (honey-fp, honeypot, session-churn, header-fp, canary, etc.) is bypassed; request proceeds straight to the upstream handler and is recorded as `admin-passthrough`.
  - `"admin-passthrough"` added to `_PASSTHROUGH_REASONS` in `core/metrics.py` (counted as clean allowed traffic, not as a block).
  - Scope: upstream paths only (`_is_admin_path` paths already had separate gating). External intel checks (AbuseIPDB / CrowdSec) are not bypassed — a genuinely compromised admin IP still generates intel signals. Bans from before a session was established (pre-login) are not bypassed.

### Tests (iteration 10)

- `tests/test_v1814_day_theme_qa.py` — **15 new tests**: `TestDayThemeSpecificElements` (10 tests — presence + no hardcoded `#21262d` + `var(--bg-elevated)` for each of the three fixed elements, plus badge text-color CSS variable check) and `TestDayThemeNoDarkHardcoded` (5 tests — no `#21262d` in JS-generated HTML strings outside `:root`/`_dp`; `_dp` map covers `#21262d`; `--bg-elevated` defined in dark and light themes; light-theme value is not the dark hex).
- `tests/test_v1814_ban_outcome_breakdown_qa.py` — **27 new tests**: `TestBanOutcomeSignalConstants` (4), `TestBanOutcomeControlColumn` (6), `TestExpiredBanNote` (7), `TestActiveBanTopReason` (4), `TestBanOutcomeCSS` (6) — covers `_BAN_OUTCOME_SIGNALS` Set, outcome-signal rendering, expired-ban yellow block, `topRsnEntry` skip logic, and new CSS classes.
- `tests/test_v1814_admin_bypass_qa.py` — **15 new tests**: `TestAdminBypassSourceGuards` (10 source-code guards — flag defined, dual condition, admin-path restriction, ban check gating, FP ban gating, heuristic gate, passthrough reason, metrics set, timeline set, ordering) and `TestAdminBypassFunctional` (5 live-proxy tests — bypass active, no session = no bypass, non-admin IP = no bypass, pre-existing ban bypassed, empty allowlist = no bypass).

### Added (iteration 11 — BLOCK_RESPONSE_MODE knob)

- **`BLOCK_RESPONSE_MODE`** new hot-reloadable knob (`config.py`, `vhost.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`): controls what blocked clients receive. `"homepage"` (default, backward-compatible) serves upstream's `/` content — the block is invisible. `"404"` serves the upstream's real 404 page with status 404 — explicit rejection. API and admin-namespace paths always get a synthetic JSON 404 regardless of mode. Overridable per-vhost.
- **`dashboards/controls.html`**: `BLOCK_RESPONSE_MODE` select knob (homepage / 404) added in the Tarpit / response section.
- **`dashboards/vhost_policy.html`**: `BLOCK_RESPONSE_MODE` added to KNOB_META (group: Tarpit / Labyrinth) for per-vhost override UI.

### Added (iteration 11 — Detection Methods "other" tooltip)

- **`dashboards/main.html`** Live Feed: Detection Methods bar chart and Top Methods table now show a hover tooltip when the bucket is "other", listing all component reasons with hit counts (e.g. `header-order-fp: 12×`). "other" label gains `cursor:help` + dotted underline. Top Methods row gains `(N reasons)` sub-label. No backend change — uses `signals[]` already returned by `detector-stats`.

### Tests (iteration 11)

- `tests/test_v1815_block_response_mode_qa.py` — **17 new tests**: `TestBlockResponseModeSourceGuards` (10 static checks — config, default, vhost coerce, hot-reload validator, 404-cache, homepage-cache, API/admin priority, controls knob, vhost_policy meta, elif guard) and `TestBlockResponseModeFunctional` (7 live-proxy tests — homepage serves `/`, 404 serves upstream 404, API JSON 404 in both modes, admin JSON 404 in both modes, no decoy-cache pollution in 404 mode, hot-reload switch).

### Fixed (iteration 13 — upstream unavailable response leaks gateway identity)

- **`proxy()` returned proxy-fingerprinting error text** (`core/proxy_handler.py`): three upstream-failure paths returned `502 "upstream error\n"`, `504 "upstream timeout\n"`, and `503 "upstream circuit open\n"` — all of which reveal that a reverse proxy exists between the client and the application. Fixed via new `_upstream_unavailable_response()` helper that consolidates all three paths into a single `503` + `Retry-After: 30` response served from cached upstream content: `BLOCK_RESPONSE_MODE="404"` → `_upstream_404_cache`; else `_decoy_cache` (homepage); else neutral HTML fallback with no gateway wording. Clients can no longer distinguish "upstream unreachable" from "upstream busy" or any normal 503 response.

### Added (iteration 13 — upstream health alert in pill + vhost display)

- **`health_score_endpoint` upstream reason** (`core/proxy_handler.py`): added a 7th health-score factor — upstream reachability. When the circuit breaker is open: `bad` status, −40 pts, detail shows seconds-until-recovery + consecutive failure count. When failure count ≥ half the open threshold: `warn`, −10 pts. Exposed as `upstream_down: bool` in the JSON response. `KEY_LABELS` / `KEY_HINTS` maps in `main.html` updated to include the new `"upstream"` key.
- **Pill UPSTREAM DOWN alert** (`dashboards/main.html`): `tick()` refactored into `_renderPill()` + `tick()`. When `upstream_down` is true the pill switches to: red background, `"● UPSTREAM DOWN"` text, slow pulse animation (`gw-pill-pulse 1.4s ease-in-out infinite`), and updated `title` tooltip. Animation and colour are cleared on recovery.
- **Pill vhost suffix** (`dashboards/main.html`): pill text now appends ` · <hostname>` (truncated to 22 chars) when a vhost filter is active in `#vhost-select`. Updates instantly on `change` via `window._renderPill` exposed from the health-score IIFE.
- **`@keyframes gw-pill-pulse`** CSS animation added; `transition` on `#gw-status-pill` extended to include `background`, `color`, and `border-color`.

### Fixed (iteration 13 — stale type assertion in test_v185_new_features.py)

- **`test_ja4h_deny_list_field_exists` expected `frozenset`** (`tests/test_v185_new_features.py`): `JA4H_DENY_LIST` was changed from `frozenset` to `set` in a prior iteration (F4, iter 8) for JSON serialisation; the assertion was never updated. Fixed: `isinstance(..., frozenset)` → `isinstance(..., set)`, docstring updated. The correct assertion is also guarded by `test_v1814_full_export_qa.py::test_ja4h_deny_list_default_is_set_not_frozenset`.

### Fixed (iteration 12 — IP intelligence dashboard 400 error)

- **`metrics_endpoint` serialised track_key hash as `ip` field** (`core/proxy_handler.py`): the clients list in `/secured/metrics` set `"ip": key` where `key` is the HMAC-derived `track_key` identity string, not the client IP. The Identity-details popover in `main.html` and `agents.html` passed `d.ip` directly to `fetchIpIntel()` → `/secured/ip-intel/<hash>` → `ipaddress.ip_address(<hash>)` raised `ValueError` → HTTP 400 → "IP intelligence unavailable: HTTP 400". Fixed: `"ip": s.last_ip or key` — uses the actual client IP when set (composite track-key entries), falls back to `key` only for pure-IP-keyed rate-limiter entries where `key` is already an IP address. Both `d.ip` and `d.last_ip` now carry the real client IP so `normalizeId`'s `raw.ip || raw.last_ip` fallback chain is correct.

### Added (iteration 12 — QA test coverage expansion)

- **`test_v1814_ip_intel_qa.py`** — 45 new tests covering the ip_intel fix end-to-end: source-inspection (`"ip": s.last_ip or key` present, `"ip": key` bare absent, `last_ip` sibling present, `id` still uses raw key); unit/parametrized tests of the `s.last_ip or key` expression (5 cases: track_key+IPv4, track_key+IPv6, empty last_ip, None last_ip, IPv6 key); functional tests verifying ip field always passes `ipaddress.ip_address()`; runtime tests with live `ip_state` injection (6 cases including `id ≠ ip` regression); `ip_intel_endpoint` validation matrix (7 valid IPs accepted, 6 invalid patterns rejected — hash/unknown/port/comma/empty/hostname); dashboard source tests (`normalizeId` raw.ip + raw.last_ip, `fetchIpIntel(d.ip)` in both `main.html` and `agents.html`).
- **`test_v1814_qa_detection.py`** — 145 tests (was 135): added `TestSecLcToken` (6 SEC tests — hex-only output safe for `<script>`, previous-hour replay window accepted, 2-hour-ago token rejected, special-char inputs rejected, oversized input no crash, `hmac.compare_digest` used) and `TestSecAutomationScript` (4 SEC tests — hex-safe token, IIFE wrapper, `</script>` closes before `</body>`, different keys produce different tokens).
- **`test_v1814_qa_modules.py`** — 168 tests (was 144): added `TestSecJwtAlgorithmConfusion` (7 — RS256/PS256/ES256/HS384/HS512 + NONE uppercase + missing-alg + tamper + constant-time-compare), `TestSecHoneyCredKeyProperties` (4 — hex-only, distinct identities, deterministic, expired-key not returned), `TestSecGraphqlBypass` (5 — introspection variants, depth boundary accounting JSON-wrapper +1, depth-over-limit), `TestSecFpTokenEntropy` (4 — hex-safe, distinct keys, IIFE wrapping, script-before-body).
- **`test_v1814_qa_ui_ux.py`** — 113 tests (was 89): added `TestAgentsSecurity` (4 — no `eval()`, no `document.write()`, `_agwTok` CSRF interceptor, no inline event handlers with server data) and `TestCrossDashboardSecurityExtended` (12 parametrized — no `eval()` in 6 dashboards, no `document.write()` in 6 dashboards, `_agwTok` CSRF interceptor in 8 dashboards).

### Fixed (iteration 14 — vhost policy no-hostname summary missing vhosts)

- **`_renderOverrides` no-hostname branch filtered to `_vhActive` only** (`dashboards/vhost_policy.html`): when no inbound hostname was selected the summary content rendered only vhosts with at least one explicit override (`_vhActive` = filtered set). Vhosts inheriting everything from global were silently excluded — the visible count was smaller than the 7 shown in the routing section. Fixed: removed the `_vhActive` filter; the loop now iterates `_vhKeys` (all vhosts in `_allVhostSummary`). Vhosts with overrides render knob rows as before; vhosts with no overrides render a dim "inherits global" badge. Each vhost header is now clickable to jump directly to that vhost in `#vhost-select`. The `"No vhost-specific overrides configured"` early-return is removed — only the `_vhKeys.length === 0` empty state remains.

### Tests (iteration 14)

- `tests/test_v1815_vhost_policy_summary_qa.py` — **19 new tests**: `TestVhostPolicySummarySourceGuards` (10 source checks — no `_vhActive` in render loop, iterates `_vhKeys`, `"inherits global"` badge present, `hasOv` gates badge, `hasOv` gates knob rows, header clickable, old early-return removed, empty state only on `_vhKeys` empty, `escapeHtml(vh)` present, singular/plural count) and `TestVhostPolicySummaryContent` (9 logic simulations — 3 vhosts → all 3 shown; zero-override vhosts show "inherits global"; vhost with overrides shows count; 7 vhosts → all 7; empty → select prompt; knob rows only under vhosts with overrides; alphabetical sort; singular/plural edge cases).

### Added (iteration 15 — operator Allow grace window + GET unban auth fix)

- **`ALLOW_BYPASS_SECS` new hot-reloadable knob** (`config.py`, `vhost.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`): grace window (default 300s, validator [0,86400]) granted when operator clicks Allow / Unban on an identity. Bug it solves: clicking Allow cleared the ban and reset `risk_score` to 0, but the next few requests from the same identity would re-trigger the same accumulated signals (session-churn 75 pts, ai-headers-incomplete, header-order-fp etc.) and re-ban within seconds.
- **`bypass_until: float` field on `IpState`** (`state.py`): operator-granted monotonic-clock deadline. `unban_endpoint` sets it to `monotonic() + ALLOW_BYPASS_SECS` when clearing. `protect()` has a new bypass gate immediately after `_admin_authed_bypass`: if `monotonic() < s.bypass_until` the request is served from upstream with `reason="operator-allowed"` recorded — heuristic detection is bypassed for the grace window.
- **`"operator-allowed"` passthrough reason** (`core/metrics.py` `_PASSTHROUGH_REASONS`, `core/proxy_handler.py` `_passthrough` timeline set): treated as clean allowed traffic — not a block. Distinct from `admin-passthrough` so SIEM can audit operator-grace events separately.
- **`metrics_endpoint` clients list exposes `bypass_secs`** countdown for dashboards.
- **`dashboards/main.html` + `agents.html` identity popover** shows `"Allowed (grace window · Ns remaining — detection bypassed)"` when `bypass_secs > 0`. Agents IIFE re-synced from main.html.
- **`dashboards/controls.html`** — `ALLOW_BYPASS_SECS` num knob (min:0, max:86400, step:60).
- **`dashboards/vhost_policy.html`** — KNOB_META entry (group: Tarpit / Labyrinth).

### Fixed (iteration 15 — GET /unban was unauthenticated)

- **`unban_endpoint` auth check was nested inside `if request.method == "POST":`** (`core/proxy_handler.py`): the GET branch (used by the Allow buttons in the UI) ran with no role check at all. Anyone reaching the URL could clear any ban or risk score via `GET /secured/unban?id=<key>`. Fixed: `_role_denied()` check moved outside the method-dispatch — now runs for both GET and POST before any work.

### Tests (iteration 15)

- `tests/test_v1815_allow_bypass_qa.py` — **18 new tests**: `TestAllowBypassSourceGuards` (13 source checks — `bypass_until` on `IpState`, `ALLOW_BYPASS_SECS` default 300, in `_VHOST_COERCE`, in `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS` with [0,86400] validator, unban sets `bypass_until` via monotonic, `protect()` has bypass gate before honey FP recording `operator-allowed`, `operator-allowed` in `_PASSTHROUGH_REASONS` + timeline `_passthrough` set, clients list includes `bypass_secs`, controls knob registered, vhost_policy KNOB_META, main.html popover shows grace), `TestUnbanAuthGet` (2 — `_role_denied` precedes method-dispatch, auth NOT nested in POST-only branch), `TestAllowBypassFunctional` (3 — unban POST sets `bypass_until` + clears risk via live admin session; `ALLOW_BYPASS_SECS=0` disables; `bypass_secs` exposed in `/metrics`).

### Added (iteration 16 — UX + persistence + perf — 2026-06-02 → 2026-06-03)

- **Reset risk action in the Risk-score-breakdown popover** (`dashboards/agents.html`, `dashboards/main.html`): operators previously had no way to clear a non-zero risk score for an identity that wasn't currently banned — the Unban button only appeared when `banned_secs > 0`. New amber `Reset risk` button shows in the breakdown popover when `risk_score > 0`; it POSTs to the existing `/secured/unban` endpoint (which already scrubs scalar score, per-reason breakdown, blocks histogram, blocked count, and grants the `ALLOW_BYPASS_SECS` grace window). CSS class `.gw-reset-risk` lives next to `.gw-unban` for visual consistency; the `unban_endpoint` did not need changes — it already implemented the full scrub.
- **SILENT badge in the Vhost Policy picker** (`dashboards/vhost_policy.html`): vhosts with no traffic in the last 30 min are tagged `— SILENT` in the dropdown, mirroring the convention from the Control-Center heatmap. Marker is additive with the `— no overrides` badge (a configured-but-quiet vhost shows just `— SILENT`; a stats-only-quiet host shows `— no overrides — SILENT`).
- **Historical vhost merge in the Vhost Policy picker** (`admin/settings.py`, `dashboards/vhost_policy.html`): `vhost-policy-data` now returns a new `seen_vhosts` array — `SELECT DISTINCT vhost FROM events WHERE vhost != '' AND ts >= now - 30 d` — so quiet hosts that fell outside the 24 h window of `/vhost-stats` remain pickable. Dropdown now merges three sources: configured (`d.vhosts`), recent stats (`sd.stats`, drives `last_seen` + SILENT), and historical (`d.seen_vhosts`).
- **Operator-configurable ban durations in the Agents + Live-feed UIs** (`dashboards/agents.html`, `dashboards/main.html`): the Banned / Really-Banned buttons hardcoded `data-secs="86400"` / `data-secs="2592000"`, so operator changes to `HOSTILE_BAN_SECS` / `REALLY_BAN_SECS` in the Thresholds card had no effect — clicks still applied the historical defaults. New window-level cache `_gwBanCfg = {banSecs, reallyBanSecs}` is populated from `/secured/config` on page load + refreshed every 60 s. Buttons interpolate the cached values into `data-secs` + title + aria-label; the `> 86400` "really-banned" badge classifier reads `_gwBanCfg.banSecs` so the live feed correctly classifies a 7200 s ban as "Banned" when `HOSTILE_BAN_SECS` is set to 7200.
- **Vacuum-DB UI hidden when DB_BACKEND ≠ sqlite** (`dashboards/settings.html`): manual VACUUM is a SQLite-only operation; Postgres / TimescaleDB has its own autovacuum daemon. The Vacuum-DB button, status text, and Last-5-runs history table now toggle off via `_dbUpdateActiveBadges(backend)` whenever Postgres is active, replaced by a short Postgres-only note. `loadVacuumHistory()` is no longer called unconditionally — it's gated by `_dbOrig === 'sqlite'` in `loadDb()` and refired on a sqlite-direction switch. Server-side `/secured/db-vacuum` and `/secured/db-vacuum-history` already had the `if DB_BACKEND != "sqlite"` short-circuit; the UI just stops surfacing the controls.

### Fixed (iteration 16)

- **DB_BACKEND switch reverted on restart when env was set** (`db/sqlite.py`): `db_load_config` skipped any knob present in `_ENV_PROVIDED_KNOBS`. `DB_BACKEND` was env-pinned whenever the operator shipped `DB_BACKEND=postgres|sqlite` via container env, so a `/secured/db-switch` choice (operator-mediated, with connectivity probe + schema init + pool reset + event-window migration) persisted to `config_kv` but reverted on every restart because env re-won at boot. Fix: `DB_BACKEND` is exempt from the env-pin in `db_load_config` only — every other knob still respects env precedence. The exemption is justified inline: `/secured/db-switch` is the operator-mediated channel; env now serves as a cold-start default that the operator can override at runtime. `POSTGRES_DSN` remains owned by `secrets_kv` / `db_load_secrets` (the secret-stomp protection is unaffected).

### Performance (iteration 16 — hot-path pass)

- **Shared upstream `ClientSession`** (`core/proxy_handler.py`, `proxy.py`): the main proxy hot-path opened `async with ClientSession(timeout=ClientTimeout(...)) as session:` per request — full TCP + TLS handshake to the upstream on every call. Replaced with a module-level `_UPSTREAM_HTTP_CLIENT` lazily created via `_get_upstream_client()`, backed by a `TCPConnector(limit=200, limit_per_host=50, ttl_dns_cache=300)`. Critical safety property: `cookie_jar=DummyCookieJar()` — without it, an upstream `Set-Cookie` from request A could leak into request B's request headers; cookies are still proxied via headers as before. Drained via `_close_upstream_client()` from `on_cleanup`. Per-request `ClientTimeout` is still constructed (cheaply) — see next item.
- **Cached `ClientTimeout`** (`core/proxy_handler.py`): `_get_upstream_timeout()` returns the same `ClientTimeout` instance until either `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_SECS` or `UPSTREAM_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS` is hot-reloaded — small allocation skipped per request.
- **Precompiled `BYPASS_PATHS` matcher** (`core/proxy_handler.py`): replaced the per-request `any(p.endswith((...,"/")) and request.path.startswith(p[:-1]) ... for p in vc('BYPASS_PATHS'))` with `_bypass_match(path, paths)`, which compiles the list once into `(prefixes:tuple, exacts:frozenset)` and reuses it until the list identity changes (hot-reload rebinds `globals()["BYPASS_PATHS"]`). The hot path becomes `path in exacts or path.startswith(prefixes)` — frozenset O(1) + a C-level builtin loop on the tuple. Semantics preserved (including the historical greedy `/static/` → `/staticx` quirk).
- **OrderedDict timeline eviction** (`state.py`, `core/metrics.py`): `timeline` and `cost_timeline` are now declared as `OrderedDict` so the per-minute roll evicts via `while timeline: oldest = next(iter(timeline)); if oldest >= cutoff: break; del timeline[oldest]` — O(buckets-to-evict) instead of the prior O(all-buckets) list-comprehension scan.

### Tests (iteration 16)

- `tests/test_v1815_unban_full_scrub.py` — 16 tests, 13 source + 3 functional. Asserts the existing `unban_endpoint` performs the full scrub (banned_until + risk_score + risk_by_reason + blocks_by_reason + blocked_count + last_risk_update + bypass_until) AND that the dashboards expose the `gw-reset-risk` button + wire its click handler. Functional test uses an `aiohttp` mini-app to seed an identity, POST `/secured/unban`, and assert every field on `IpState` is scrubbed.
- `tests/test_v1814_vhost_policy_picker.py` — extended from 14 to **19 tests**: 3 SILENT-marker tests (constant present, `_now - _ls > _SILENT_THRESHOLD_S` predicate, marker orthogonal to `— no overrides`), 2 `seen_vhosts` tests (HTML consumes `d.seen_vhosts`, backend returns `seen_vhosts` from `DISTINCT vhost FROM events`).
- `tests/test_v1814_db_backend_persists.py` (4 tests) + `tests/test_v1814_db_backend_persists_edge.py` (6 tests) — `db_load_config` exempts `DB_BACKEND` from the env-pin; non-DB_BACKEND knobs still respect env; invalid `config_kv` value falls back to env (validator rejection); validator=None handled; round-trip env→postgres→sqrite; the exemption is local to the env-pin check (doesn't widen to `POSTGRES_DSN`); end-of-load `db_config_loaded` slog still emits `applied`/`env_pinned`.
- `tests/test_v1814_vacuum_sqlite_only.py` (7 tests) + `tests/test_v1814_vacuum_endpoint_gates.py` (9 tests) — UI invariants (wrap IDs, `_dbUpdateActiveBadges` toggling, postgres-skip in fetch, post-switch refresh) AND server-side gates on `/db-vacuum` + `/db-vacuum-history` (backend guard before `sqlite3.connect`, `400` + `history:[]` contract, role-gated, identical predicates).
- `tests/test_v1814_ban_duration_dynamic.py` (12 tests) — cache + loader declared in both pages, cache warmed BEFORE first `tick()`, 60 s refresh interval, no hardcoded `data-secs="86400"` / `data-secs="2592000"`, classifier reads `_gwBanCfg.banSecs`, fallback defaults present in declaration.
- `tests/test_v1814_perf_pass.py` (13 tests) + `tests/test_v1814_perf_pass_behavioral.py` (16 tests) — perf pass anchors (module-level `_UPSTREAM_HTTP_CLIENT`, `DummyCookieJar`, pooled `TCPConnector`, hot-path no longer constructs per-request session, `_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_CACHE` exists, `_bypass_match` defined and used, `OrderedDict` timeline typing, head-pop eviction) AND behaviour (cache identity invalidation, timeout knob-change invalidates, idempotent client + post-close lazy re-init, `DummyCookieJar` installed, head-pop preserves in-retention buckets).
- `tests/test_pure.py` BYPASS_PATHS anchors updated to accept either the legacy `any(...)` form or the precompiled `_bypass_match(...)` form (6 tests adjusted).

## [1.8.13] — 2026-05-24

### Fix (honeypots dashboard — 2026-05-25)

- **`method` column missing from SQLite migrations** (`db/sqlite.py`): `_SCHEMA_MIGRATIONS` lacked an entry for `("events", "method", "TEXT", "TEXT")`. Armv7/SQLite devices upgraded from pre-1.8.x schemas had no `method` column; the `db_writer_loop` INSERT (which names `method` explicitly) failed silently, storing no events — honeypots and events dashboards showed 0 records. Fixed by adding the migration entry; idempotent `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` applies safely on every startup.
- **`method` column added to Postgres events schema** (`db/postgres.py`): `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events` did not include `method`; `pg_insert_event()` omitted `method` from the INSERT. Both fixed: `method TEXT` added to the base schema, migration entry added to `_SCHEMA_MIGRATIONS` (shared with SQLite), and `pg_insert_event()` updated to accept and store the HTTP method. `_PG_MISSING_COLUMNS` emptied (was `{"method", "vhost"}` — both are now real Postgres columns added via migrations 1.8.0/1.8.13).
- **`core/metrics.py` Postgres event write updated**: `pg_insert_event` call now passes `method` so the HTTP verb is stored on the Postgres backend.

### Security (re-validation iteration — 2026-05-25)

- **OIDC id_token `sub` claim made mandatory** (`admin/oidc.py`): added `"sub"` to PyJWT `require` list (OIDC Core §3.1.3.3 compliance). INT4-10 sub-binding check is now unconditional — an id_token with empty or absent `sub` is rejected with `oidc_id_token_missing_sub` error, closing an identity-confusion bypass where an attacker-controlled IdP could return an empty `sub` claim.
- **Dead OIDC code removed** (`proxy.py`): local `_verify_jwt_hs256` and `_jwt_required_for` definitions that shadowed the canonical `integrations.jwt` implementations without being called through the local path were removed.
- **`REDIRECT_MAZE_ENABLED` default changed to ON** (`config.py`): default changed from `"0"` to `"1"`; threshold gate (risk ≥ 80) prevents triggering on benign traffic.
- **`dast-smoke.sh` version-disclosure check fixed**: stale `"1.8.7"` string updated to `"1.8.13"` and grep changed from regex to fixed-string (`-F`) to prevent SVG path-coordinate false positives from upstream responses.
- **20 new QA tests** (`tests/test_v1811_oidc_idtoken_verify.py`): full id_token verification coverage — alg-confusion prevention (alg:none, HS256 rejected), RS256/ES256/RS384, tampered signatures, expiry/nbf, issuer/audience/nonce validation, kid-miss JWKS refresh, `sub` required, INT4-10 sub-mismatch.

### Security (post-release secure code review — 2026-05-25)

- **C1 — ReDoS DoS fixed in the Log4Shell WAF body regex** (`config.py`): the
  obfuscated-JNDI matcher used four unbounded `[\$:{}]*` runs → catastrophic
  O(n²) backtracking; an unauthenticated `${`-flood body stalled the event loop
  (~18 s at 200 KB, hours over the 4 MiB scan window). Bounded each run to
  `{0,64}` → linear (200 KB now ~34 ms); detection unchanged (the gadget
  pattern backstops real payloads).
- **H2/H3 — two more body-regex ReDoS fixed** (`config.py`): the cmd
  `$(…)`/`<(…)` group (`[a-z]+[^)]*` overlap) and the xss `src=…` group
  (`\s*=\s*["']?\s*` adjacent runs) were quadratic; bounded the runs (H3 11 s →
  1.2 ms, H2 677 ms → 0.6 ms). Detection unchanged.
- **H1 — stored XSS via `SERVICE_OWNER` fixed** (`core/middleware.py`,
  `core/proxy_handler.py`): the org name was injected into a dashboard
  `<script>` through `json.dumps` (JS-string-safe but not `<script>`-safe), so
  `</script>…` broke out and ran on every dashboard load. Now escapes `< > &`
  in the injected JSON **and** the setter rejects `<`, `>`, control chars.
- **H4 — hardcoded admin key removed from `attack_demo.py`** (now reads
  `$AGW_ADMIN_KEY`). The previously-committed key **must be rotated**.
- **`test_165`** updated with test values for the 10 `SEC_*` response-header
  knobs (coverage gap; no product change).
- **External JS dependencies hardened** (the only two third-party scripts):
  **Leaflet** (Geo dashboard, `dashboards/geo.html`) stays on the `unpkg.com`
  CDN (SRI-pinned) but now shows a **visible error banner** when it fails to load
  (offline / blocked / integrity mismatch) instead of a silently-broken map —
  `onerror` flag + an init guard that reveals the banner before any `L.*` call.
  **Cloudflare Turnstile** (challenge page, `challenge/js_challenge.py`) now
  **fails closed fast**: a loader that can't load / fails integrity rejects
  immediately ("access blocked"), no token → no cookie. Optional SRI pin via new
  `TURNSTILE_SRI` knob (default empty — Cloudflare rotates `api.js`, so a stale
  pin would block all new visitors; compute + refresh yourself to enable).
  Guard: `tests/test_v1813_external_js_guards.py`.

### Added

- **Redirect maze wired in + made configurable** (1.7.3 P2 — `detection/redirect_maze.py`,
  `config.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`, `proxy.py`, `vhost.py`,
  `dashboards/vhost_policy.html`): the redirect-maze detector — previously an
  orphan module that raised `ImportError` because its config knobs were never
  defined — is now functional. It is **distinct from the AI Labyrinth**
  (`LABYRINTH_*`, hidden-link tarpit): the maze bounces identities already at
  `risk ≥ REDIRECT_MAZE_THRESHOLD` through `REDIRECT_MAZE_DEPTH` HMAC-signed 302
  hops (public `/maze` route, dest- and identity-bound tokens, 30 s TTL);
  completing all hops in `< REDIRECT_MAZE_MIN_MS` fires the `redirect-maze-bot`
  signal (weight `REDIRECT_MAZE_SCORE`, default 55). New knobs
  `REDIRECT_MAZE_ENABLED` / `_THRESHOLD` / `_DEPTH` / `_MIN_MS` / `_SCORE` are
  hot-reloadable and per-vhost overridable; `redirect-maze-bot` is registered in
  `RISK_WEIGHTS` + `SIGNAL_KNOB`. **Ships OFF** (`REDIRECT_MAZE_ENABLED=0`) so it
  never reroutes live traffic until an operator opts in. **Controls dashboard
  widgets** (`dashboards/controls.html`): `REDIRECT_MAZE_ENABLED` toggle in the
  Defenses & scoring table (labelled "Redirect Maze") + `REDIRECT_MAZE_THRESHOLD`
  / `_DEPTH` / `_MIN_MS` numeric inputs in the Thresholds card, grouped next to
  the AI Labyrinth knobs; signal label + severity/description + cost metadata
  added so it renders cleanly in the scoring table.

### Fixed

- **Honeypots dashboard always empty in challenge-first mode** (`core/proxy_handler.py`):
  the JS challenge gate ran *before* the honeypot/suspicious-path detectors, so a
  cookieless scanner hitting a trap path (`/.env`, `/.git/HEAD`, …) was
  silent-decoyed at the gate as a generic `chal-required` and never reached the
  honeypot detector — so no `honeypot-silent`/`suspicious-path` event was ever
  written and the Honeypots dashboard stayed empty even while bots hammered the
  traps. Fix: trap paths (`HONEYPOT_PATHS` ∪ `is_suspicious_path`) are now
  **exempt from the challenge gate** and fall through to the dedicated detectors,
  which record the real reason + ban + decoy. Verified live: cookieless probes to
  `/.env` now return the 404 decoy and write `honeypot-silent`. Guard:
  `tests/test_functional.py::test_honeypot_path_exempt_from_challenge_gate`.
- **Login Sign-in button dead under strict CSP** (`admin/users.py`,
  `dashboards/login.html`): the login page's CSP was hardened to `script-src
  'self'` (F-11, "no inline scripts") but `login.html` still shipped an inline
  `<script>`, so the browser silently blocked it and the Sign-in click handler
  never attached — login was impossible from a real browser (curl, which ignores
  CSP, still rendered fine). Fixed with a per-request CSP nonce: the page's own
  script runs via `script-src 'self' 'nonce-…'` while injected inline scripts
  stay blocked (F-11 intent preserved). Guard: `tests/test_login_csp_nonce.py`.
- **Controls vhost selector skipped its empty-list sync** (`dashboards/controls.html`):
  `load()` decided the vhost-search box visibility from `body.vhosts.length`,
  which the regression guard (`test_rv6_load_syncs_vhosts_without_length_guard`)
  flags because length-gating risks skipping the option sync on an empty list.
  Switched to `fresh.size` (the de-duplicated vhost `Set` already built for the
  add/remove sync) — same threshold, no length gate.

### Security

- **URL-encoded injection bypass in `is_suspicious_path`** (`detection/paths.py`):
  `request.path_qs` in aiohttp is NOT percent-decoded, so payloads like
  `%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C%2Fscript%3E` were passed to `is_suspicious_path()` as
  the raw encoded string — the `<script\b` pattern never matched and the request
  was recorded as `reason='ok'`. All 70+ `SUSPICIOUS_PATH_PATTERNS` were affected
  for any percent-encoded variant of their triggers. Fix: `is_suspicious_path()`
  now tests both the raw path and `urllib.parse.unquote(path)`. Discovered during
  §12 E2E black-box probe on 2026-05-25; all 3 arch images rebuilt with the fix.

### Tests

- New `tests/test_redirect_maze.py` (20 tests): token sign/verify roundtrip,
  dest/identity binding, expiry + skew, `should_maze()` gating, signal
  registration, public-route exemption, and endpoint hop/landing behaviour.
- Extended the knob-integration guards (`test_165_every_knob_persists_round_trip`,
  vhost-coerce + vhost-policy-meta coverage) to include the new maze knobs.

## [1.8.12] — 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Honeypots dashboard restructure** (`dashboards/honeypots.html`, `core/proxy_handler.py`): full four-section layout — Overview (summary stats), Traps (top-path effectiveness table with per-path hit counts), Attackers (per-IP attack storyboard showing ordered steps), and Threat Intel (scanner-tool leaderboard derived client-side from `/secured/attack-playbook`). Two new backend fields added to `honeypots_data` endpoint: `trap_effectiveness` (top trap paths ranked by hits) and `attackers` (per-IP ordered step list). `escapeHtml` on all user-supplied fields; intervals registered in `_timers`.

### Tests

- **`tests/test_v1812_honeypots_sections.py`**: static layout checks (all four section IDs present, `trap_effectiveness` + `attackers` fields consumed); dynamic tests seeding trap and attacker events and verifying the endpoint returns correct shapes.

---

## [1.8.11] — 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Attack Playbook card** (`dashboards/agents.html`, `core/proxy_handler.py`): new card at the bottom of the Agents page turning honeypot/trap catches into a "how the attack works" playbook grouped by technique. Reasons covered: `honeypot`, `honeypot-silent`, `bot-trap`, `honey-cred`, `canary-echo`, `canary-probe-miss`. Each group shows: what the technique is, ≤6 deduped `(method, path)` examples, hit count, last-seen, and the governing defense control (live ON/OFF via `SIGNAL_KNOB_JS` with Controls deep-link). Backend: new `attack_playbook_endpoint` + route `GET /secured/attack-playbook`. `loadPlaybook()` auto-refreshes every 30 s; interval registered in `_timers`. All user-supplied paths/methods rendered via `escapeHtml`.
- **Service owner label** (`config.py`, all dashboard footers): new `SERVICE_OWNER` knob — operator-set string persisted to `config_kv`, rendered in every dashboard footer as "Operated by \<owner\>". Hot-reloadable.
- **Day/night theme** (all 12 dashboard files): full light/dark theme toggle. `--bright` / `--dim` CSS variables; `html[data-theme="light"]` block; `#theme-toggle` button; `_toggleTheme` function; `_gwTheme` Chart.js `afterInit` plugin; `_applyChartColorsToInstance` for live chart recolour; `_TILE_LIGHT` / `_TILE_DARK` Leaflet tile swap in `geo.html`. Theme persisted via `GET/PUT /secured/ui-theme` endpoint.
- **Body size limit increases** (`core/proxy_handler.py`): `UPSTREAM_MAX_BODY` raised from 2 MiB to 4 MiB; `UPSTREAM_MAX_RESP` raised from 8 MiB to 17 MiB.

### Fixed

- **Thresholds Apply Changes button** (`dashboards/controls.html`): button was non-functional after a prior refactor; wired correctly to submit handler.
- **Dead `else setInterval` removed** (`dashboards/agents.html`): orphaned `setInterval` in an unreachable `else` branch removed; resolves `test_setinterval_tracked_in_timers[agents.html]` failure.
- **M-4 `ip_bans` table not cleared in functional test fixture** (`tests/test_functional.py`): `gw_client` fixture now clears `ip_bans` between tests, preventing ban-state leakage across tests.

### Tests

- **`tests/test_v1811_service_owner.py`**: knob exists + hot-reloadable + persists + renders in every dashboard footer.
- **`tests/test_v1811_theme.py`** (CSS-01–12 + JS-01–06 + DB-01–04 + API endpoint): CSS variable definitions, theme toggle button/function, Chart.js afterInit plugin, Leaflet tile swap, `credentials:'include'` in theme fetch, DB get/set/fallback, and live API roundtrip.
- **`tests/test_v1810_attack_playbook.py`** (7 tests): endpoint + route registered; dynamic spin-up seeds honeypot + non-honeypot events, verifies groups honeypot-only, correct counts/examples, `no-store` header, and `mins` clamp.
- **Full suite**: 1017 passed (unit+pure), 38 functional, 23 integration.

### Validation

- **Trivy (armv7)**: 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM — `alpine 3.23.4`
- **Images**: `1.8.11-amd64` `sha256:49ff121a1795` · `1.8.11-arm64` `sha256:79d4a1a5ea00` · `1.8.11-armv7` `sha256:b3396800a97d` · manifest `sha256:7d58b47cf431`

---

## [1.8.10] — 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Collapsible left sidebar** (all 9 dashboard pages): full-hide toggle (click arrow button collapses to icon-only rail; click again restores). Sidebar state persisted in `localStorage`; accordion sub-items animate open/close.
- **Controls section icon-rail** (`dashboards/controls.html`): second-level hide (`#ctrl-nav`) — collapsible icon-rail for the Controls-page section navigation, matching the sidebar pattern.
- **Settings section icon-rail** (`dashboards/settings.html`): `#settings-nav` collapsible icon-rail for Settings-page section navigation.
- **Pre-flight gates** added to `rules.md`: Gate 0a (version consistency — `GW_VERSION` matches in `proxy.py`, compose, all dashboards) and Gate 0b (admin-key strength ≥ 16-char random; compose uses env-passthrough).

### Fixed

- **SIEM footer stale version** (`dashboards/siem.html`): `AntiBot/WAF GW 1.8.6` → `AntiBotWaf_GW_1.8.10` (space form slipped through bump script; Gate 0a now catches it).
- **Topbar overlap** (`dashboards/controls.html`): topbar z-index/position fix to prevent overlap with sticky section headers.
- **Per-vhost knob persistence**: `_to_bool` coercion applied uniformly; `vhost_policy` KNOB_META completeness verified.
- **2FA card robustness**: 2FA status endpoint hardened against 500 on missing TOTP secret; backend guards added.
- **SSO/CSRF cookie self-heal**: CSRF and SSO session cookies re-issued transparently on expiry without forcing re-login.

### Tests

- **`tests/test_v189_sidebar_collapse.py`**, **`test_v189_ctrlnav_rail.py`**, **`test_v189_setnav_rail.py`**: sidebar collapse/expand HTML structure, icon-rail existence, localStorage key, accordion animation classes across all dashboard files.
- **`tests/test_v1810_csrf_autorefresh.py`**, **`test_v1810_riskbreakdown_control_column.py`**, **`test_v1810_riskbreakdown_enrichment.py`**, **`test_v1810_riskmodal_actions.py`**, **`test_v1810_admin_probe_classification.py`**, **`test_v1810_csrf_session_regression.py`**, **`test_v1810_csrf_shim_coverage.py`**, **`test_v1810_infra_restart_knobs.py`**, **`test_v1810_trusted_proxies_hotreload.py`**, **`test_v1810_2fa_status_robust.py`**, **`test_v1810_admin_key_strength.py`**, **`test_v1810_version_consistency.py`**, **`test_v1810_vhost_knob_persist.py`**, **`test_v1810_score_controls.py`**, **`test_v1810_topbar_overlap.py`**, **`test_v1810_topbar_overlap_dynamic.py`**: full coverage of the above feature areas (258 new tests).
- **Full suite**: 976 unit, 38 functional, 23 integration, 20 component — all pass.

### Validation

- **Trivy**: 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH (amd64 + arm64 + armv7) — CVE-2026-8328 MEDIUM (`python-3.14 ftplib.py`) accepted risk (ftplib unused)
- **Images**: `1.8.10-amd64` `sha256:9302385ca727` · `1.8.10-arm64` `sha256:a552480bd7bc` · `1.8.10-armv7` `sha256:4c4b792553f7` · manifest `sha256:f263551212302`

---

## [1.8.9] — 2026-05-19

### Added

- **Kill-switch knobs for all detectors** (30 new env vars, all default ON — `config.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`): every previously always-on WAF/detection control now has an individually toggleable knob enabling per-deployment opt-out via environment variable or hot-reload. New knobs: `WAF_BODY_ENABLED`, `WAF_SMUGGLING_ENABLED`, `WAF_VERB_OVERRIDE_ENABLED`, `WAF_HEADER_INJECTION_ENABLED`, `WAF_GRAPHQL_ENABLED`, `WAF_UPLOAD_ENABLED`, `WAF_SLOWLORIS_ENABLED`, `ACCEPT_WILDCARD_CHECK_ENABLED`, `SESSION_CHURN_ENABLED`, `JA4H_DENY_ENABLED`, `HOST_BLOCKING_ENABLED`, `REQUIRED_HEADERS_ENABLED`, `JA4_REQUIRED_ENABLED`, `UPSTREAM_AUTH_FAIL_ENABLED`, `RATE_LIMIT_IP_ENABLED`, `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`, `FP_BAN_CHECK_ENABLED`, `TRAFFIC_THRESHOLD_ENABLED`, `TLS_FP_BLOCK_ENABLED`, `JWT_VALIDATION_ENABLED`, `CUSTOM_RULES_ENABLED`, `ENDPOINT_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`, `HONEY_CRED_ENABLED`, `REDIRECT_MAZE_ENABLED`, `CANARY_PROBE_ENABLED`, `LLM_HEURISTIC_ENABLED`, `AUTOMATION_PROBE_ENABLED`, `INTERACTION_PROBE_ENABLED`, `COORDINATED_ATTACK_ENABLED`, `JOURNEY_CHECK_ENABLED`. All accept `"1"/"true"/"yes"` via `os.environ.get`. Hot-reloadable; per-vhost overridable.

### Tests

- `test_165_every_knob_persists_round_trip` extended with 30 new test values covering every new kill-switch knob.
- **`tests/test_component.py`** (20 tests): first component-test scaffold; spins up real gateway stack, verifies key architectural invariants.
- **Full suite**: 961 unit+pure, 38 functional, 23 integration, 20 component — all pass.

### Validation

- **Trivy**: 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM (all 3 arches)
- **Images**: `1.8.9-amd64` `sha256:dd0b78345b30` · `1.8.9-arm64` `sha256:1d7dd697ec29` · `1.8.9-armv7` `sha256:473de068802785` · manifest `sha256:661a65abcbc9`

---

## [1.8.8] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Redis IP/CIDR allowlist** (`core/proxy_handler.py`, `config.py`): new `REDIS_ALLOW_LIST` knob — only listed IPs/CIDRs may connect to the Redis sidecar; empty list defaults to open (no regression). Enforced at connect time.
- **`REDIS_REQUIRE_TLS`** (`config.py`, `integrations/redis_client.py`): new knob; defaults to `True` (production hardening). Set to `false` in `docker-compose.yml` via env-passthrough for local dev with plain `redis://` sidecar.
- **Ed25519 mesh signing** (`admin/mesh.py`, `tests/test_v188_ed25519_mesh.py`): gateway-to-gateway mesh calls signed with Ed25519 key pair; signature verified on receipt. Replay protection via nonce + timestamp window.

### Fixed

- **B1 — Tarpit log spam** (`challenge/tarpit.py`): `ClientConnectionResetError` on bot mid-stream disconnect now caught silently (`except ConnectionResetError: pass`) instead of logged.
- **B2 — `secrets_kv` self-heal** (`db/postgres.py`): `_pg_mirror_kv` now attempts a one-shot `db_init_postgres()` on `UndefinedTable` error, then rate-limits retries to 1/min. Prevents schema-not-created errors spamming logs after PG unavailable at boot.
- **B3 — `POSTGRES_DSN` propagation** (`db/sqlite.py`): `POSTGRES_DSN` was missing from `_refresh_integration_state._propagate`; `proxy_handler.py` retained empty import-time binding after `db_load_secrets()` loaded the real DSN. Added to propagate dict.
- **B4 — Settings DB modal hint inverted** (`dashboards/settings.html`): ternary logic for "no DSN configured" / "DSN saved" hints was reversed; restructured. `autocomplete="off"` added to DSN input to prevent browser autofill triggering `_dsnUserTouched` prematurely.
- **B5 — Vhost filter test assertions** (`tests/test_vhost_filtering.py`): 3 tests checked for raw SQL pattern `"vhost = ?"` after code was refactored to `db_read_events(vhost=…)` abstraction; assertions updated.
- **B6 (CRITICAL) — HTTP 500 on invalid UTF-8 headers** (`identity.py`): five `.encode()` calls in `browser_fingerprint()`, `_header_order_sig()`, `_fp_hash()`, and `compute_ja4h()` raised `UnicodeEncodeError` on requests with surrogate code-points (e.g. `User-Agent: \xff\xfe\x00…`). Changed all five to `.encode("utf-8", errors="replace")`. Found during §15f DAST header fuzzing.

### Security

- **CVE-2026-26007** (`cryptography`): upgraded to ≥ 46.0.5.

### Tests

- **`tests/test_v188_redis_security.py`**, **`test_v188_ed25519_mesh.py`**, **`test_v188_db_settings_merge.py`**, **`test_v188_session_fixes.py`**, **`test_v188_startup_fixes.py`**, **`test_v188_settings_subnav.py`**, **`test_v188_backend_aware_reads.py`**: 7 new test files formalising the 1.8.8 feature set.
- `test_pure.py` (+2 regression tests): `test_browser_fingerprint_invalid_utf8_surrogate_does_not_raise`, `test_header_order_sig_invalid_utf8_does_not_raise` (B6 guard).
- **Full suite**: 959 unit+pure, 38 functional, 23 integration — all pass (830 test_pure total).

### Validation

- **Trivy**: 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM (amd64 + arm64 + armv7)
- **Images**: `1.8.8-amd64` · `1.8.8-arm64` · `1.8.8-armv7` (`sha256:293c14b1`, rebuilt 2026-05-18 to include B6 surrogate fix) · manifest `sha256:211e433862aa`

---

## [1.8.7] — 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Score breakdown UX overhaul** (`dashboards/agents.html`, `dashboards/analytics.py`): expandable per-signal breakdown panel in the risk modal; `RISK_DETAIL_JS` / `BLOCK_DETAIL_JS` JS constants for label rendering; `score_source` field on events.
- **DB backend section merged Controls → Settings** (`dashboards/settings.html`, `dashboards/controls.html`): DB-backend selector (SQLite ↔ Postgres), DSN input, and validation pipeline moved from the Controls page to a dedicated Settings card. Hot-swap without process restart (`_propagate_global()` replaces prior `os._exit(0)` approach). `pg_pool_reset()` on DSN change.
- **Controls activation-order management** (`dashboards/controls.html`, `tests/test_v187_controls_order.py`): drag-and-drop signal activation order with `signal_orders_endpoint`; actor identity uses `_request_username` (session-verified) instead of forgeable `X-Admin-User` header.
- **Settings vhost/upstream identity strip** (`dashboards/settings.html`, `tests/test_v187_settings_vhost_strip.py`): Settings page redacts `scheme://netloc` of upstream from displayed values; vhost-strip covers all vhost-keyed fields. 29 tests (H01–H08, J01–J14, A01–A02, V01–V05).

### Security

- **DET4-02 — Redirect maze dest binding** (`detection/redirect_maze.py`): `dest` parameter now bound in HMAC token; unsigned `dest` values rejected.
- **DET4-03 — Interaction probe identity binding** (`detection/interaction.py`): interaction token now binds to `get_identity()` (not raw IP); cross-identity reuse rejected.
- **DET4-04 — All-identical-timestamp bypass** (`detection/interaction.py`): all-zero or all-identical event timestamps now rejected as bot heuristic.
- **PROXY4-01 — UPSTREAM hot-reload SSRF** (`core/proxy_handler.py`): `_upstream_safe_to_reload()` validates hot-reload UPSTREAM values against RFC1918/link-local/loopback ranges before applying.
- **PROXY4-02 — Host header injection in Location rewrite** (`core/proxy_handler.py`): `ALLOWED_HOSTS` validates `Host` header before use in `Location` rewrite; unknown host falls back to `up_parsed.netloc`.
- **PROXY4-03 — Module `__setattr__` builtin overwrite** (`proxy.py`): `_PROPAGATE_NEVER` frozenset blocks `open`, `exec`, `eval`, `__builtins__`, `__import__` from being overwritten via hot-reload propagation.
- **`decimal.Decimal` crash on Postgres → SQLite migration** (`db/postgres.py`): `float(r[0])` cast added to row read; `pg_pool_reset()` exposed.

### Tests

- **`tests/test_v187_security.py`** (37 tests): DET4-02/03/04, PROXY4-01/02/03 verified.
- **`tests/test_v187_settings_vhost_strip.py`** (29 tests): H01–H08 HTML, J01–J14 JS, A01–A02 admin, V01–V05 vhost.

- `test_pure.py`: +121 targeted survivor-kill tests (828 total); `test_critical.py`: ALLOW_PRIVATE_UPSTREAM removed from hot-reload round-trip.
- **Full suite**: 3285 passed, 0 failed (2026-05-16 clean run).

### Validation

- **Trivy**: 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH (amd64 + arm64 + armv7)
- **Images**: `1.8.7-amd64` `sha256:7088e62334952` · `1.8.7-arm64` `sha256:1480e48b3921c` · `1.8.7-armv7` `sha256:4c724621d63da`

---

## [1.8.6] — 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Controls-nav split-pane** (`dashboards/controls.html`, `dashboards/controls_testA.html`, `dashboards/controls_testB.html`): split-pane Controls page with left navigation rail; prototype A/B endpoint scaffolding (`dashboards/controls.py`) with viewer-role guards.
- **Score breakdown detail expansion** (`dashboards/agents.html`, `dashboards/agents.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`): `RISK_DETAIL_JS` / `BLOCK_DETAIL_JS` JS constant strings; `score_source` missed-list field on events for per-signal detail breakdown in the risk modal.

### Security

- **P0-1** (`config.py`): `/login/totp` missing from `_ADMIN_LOGIN_SUBPATHS` → 2FA page inaccessible; `/interaction-report` missing from `_ADMIN_PUBLIC_SUBPATHS` → interaction probe silently dropped. Both paths added.
- **P0-2** (`db/sqlite.py`): `oidc_sub` column missing from `_SCHEMA_MIGRATIONS` → SSO sub claim not persisted on existing deployments. Migration entry added.
- **P0-3** (`admin/oidc.py`): no `oidc_sub` binding on first SSO login; no collision check → username takeover via pre-created local account with matching `preferred_username`. Extracted `sub` from userinfo; collision guard; bind on first login; reject missing `sub`.
- **P0-4** (`admin/users.py`): `_user_load_all` SELECT excluded `oidc_sub` → admin dashboard could not display bound IdP subject. Added to SELECT.
- **P0-5** (`admin/oidc.py`): OIDC session cookie `SameSite=Lax` → sent on top-level cross-site navigations. Changed to `SameSite=Strict`.
- **P1-1** (`admin/users.py`): `totp_verify_endpoint` had no rate limiting → 6-digit TOTP brute-forceable at network speed. `_login_rate_limit(ip)` added; 429 + `Retry-After: 60` on excess.
- **P1-2/3** (`dashboards/siem.py`, `dashboards/siem.html`): `siem_alert_rules_endpoint` had no CSRF protection; SIEM JS calls had no `X-CSRF-Token`. `@_require_csrf` on endpoint; token injected in all 3 fetch calls.
- **P1-4/5** (`core/proxy_handler.py`, `dashboards/controls.html`, `dashboards/agents.html`): `ban_endpoint`, `config_endpoint`, `unban_endpoint` had no CSRF protection; controls/agents HTML had no token injection. `@_require_csrf` on all three; `window.fetch` IIFE auto-injects token for all non-GET/HEAD.
- **P1-6** (`db/sqlite.py`): `user_update` built UPDATE with unsanitised column names → SQL injection via key injection. `_USER_MUTABLE` frozenset validates all column names before query.
- **P1-7** (`integrations/ja4.py`): `_ja4_peer_trusted()` returned `True` when `JA4_TRUSTED_NETS` empty → fail-open. Changed to `return False`.
- **P1-8** (`detection/interaction.py`): interaction probe accepted arbitrary `duration_ms` / `offset_ms` from client → integer overflow / scoring bypass. Clamped to `[0, _MAX_OFFSET_MS=60000]`.
- **AUTH4-01/02** (`admin/auth.py`, `admin/users.py`): deleted-user sessions returned `"admin"` (fail-open); user delete didn't revoke active sessions. Fail-closed; session revoke on delete.
- **AUTH4-03** (`admin/mesh.py`): 5 mesh endpoints had no role guard → any logged-in user could access topology data. `_role_denied(admin|maintainer)` on all 5.
- **AUTH4-07/08/12/13** (`admin/oidc.py`): OIDC nonce missing (replay possible); session cap not enforced on OIDC login; no HTTPS check on `OIDC_ISSUER` at startup; opaque error codes to prevent open redirect via IdP error string reflection.
- **AUTH4-10** (`dashboards/controls.py`): prototype endpoints checked role only, not `_internal_authed`. Require both.
- **DET4-05/06/07** (`detection/interaction.py`): exception propagation → 500 on malformed input; no replay protection on interaction tokens; body read limit reduced from 65536 to 16384 bytes.
- **PROXY4-07/09** (`rate_limit.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`): `_PROBE_RL` never pruned; `signal_orders_endpoint` used forgeable `X-Admin-User` header.
- **PROXY4-10** (`rate_limit.py`): `_TOTP_PENDING` never pruned → unbounded growth. Evicted after 600 s.

### Tests

- `_csrf_hdr` helper added to 8 test files; `test_oidc.py` updated for `SameSite=Strict` and opaque error codes.
- **Full suite**: 2988 passed, 1 skipped — no regressions.

### Validation

- **Bandit**: 0 High / 0 Critical
- **Trivy**: 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH (amd64 + arm64 + armv7)
- **Images**: `1.8.6-amd64` `sha256:2922f3c6` · `1.8.6-arm64` `sha256:d4263f72` · `1.8.6-armv7` `sha256:e21970ad`

---

## [1.8.5] — 2026-05-15

### Security
- **SEC-05 — session cookie `Secure` flag driven by `SESSION_SECURE` config** (`admin/users.py`): Login response now uses `SESSION_SECURE` (the env-driven boolean from config) instead of an inline `bool(int(os.environ.get("TLS_ENABLED","0")))` read. Consistent with how all other TLS-gated behaviour is controlled.
- **SEC-01 — fail-closed XFF default** (`config.py`, `helpers.py`, `proxy.py`): `TRUST_XFF` default changed from `"first"` to `"none"`. `helpers._peer_is_trusted_proxy` changed from fail-open (`return True` when `TRUSTED_PROXIES_NETS` is empty) to fail-closed (`return False`). Same fail-closed logic applied to the inline `_trusted()` closure inside the `proxy.py` `get_ip` wrapper. Operators who rely on XFF must now explicitly set `TRUST_XFF=first` and `TRUSTED_PROXIES`. Existing deployments already setting those env vars are unaffected.
- **SEC-08 — scrypt work factor raised to N=2^17** (`admin/users.py`): `_SCRYPT_N` raised from `2**14` to `2**17` (8× harder to brute-force). `maxmem` raised from 64 MB to 256 MB in both `_password_hash` and `_password_verify` to satisfy the increased memory requirement.
- **SEC-07 — SSRF guard on `WEBHOOK_URL`** (`integrations/webhook.py`): `_webhook_url_safe()` validates the configured webhook URL before each POST. Rejects non-HTTP(S) schemes, empty hosts, and bare IP addresses that resolve to private/loopback/link-local/reserved ranges (CWE-918). Public hostnames are allowed; DNS resolution is deferred to the OS so no additional dependencies are introduced.

### Fixed
- **CODE-19 — deterministic `unique_paths` cap** (`core/proxy_handler.py`): Changed `set.pop()` (non-deterministic eviction) to a `len < 400` guard before `add`. Prevents unbounded growth while avoiding silently dropping arbitrary paths.
- **CODE-13 — SQLite reconnect after `db_writer_loop` exception** (`db/sqlite.py`): Connection is now closed and re-opened after any exception in the writer loop. Prevents a permanently broken connection from silently dropping all subsequent DB writes.
- **CODE-05 — `_fp_session_creations` TTL prune** (`rate_limit.py`): Added step 11 to `_prune_state_loop`: evicts fingerprint entries whose most-recent timestamp is older than `SESSION_CHURN_WINDOW_S`. Prevents UA-rotating attackers from inflating memory indefinitely.
- **UI-12 — SIEM "Missed" label** (`dashboards/siem.html`): Chart dataset label corrected from `'Bypassed'` to `'Missed'` to match the metric definition (detections that scored below the ban threshold, not bypassed traffic).

### Tests
- **`tests/test_code_review_fixes.py`** (39 tests): Fixed cross-test contamination in C2/V2/D1 test classes. `_propagate` helper and manual propagation loops now also directly patch `core.proxy_handler.get_ip.__globals__` to handle the case where `test_functional.py` loads an orphaned proxy module via importlib at collection time, causing `get_ip.__globals__` to point to a dict not reachable via `sys.modules`.
- **`tests/test_pure.py`** (+8): S45–S49 static QA tests for `BOT_DETECTION_ENABLED` gate (operator-passthrough action, post-ban-check ordering, endpoint rate-limit ordering, dashboard switch data attributes, render function call chain).
- **`tests/test_functional.py`** (+4): F11c dynamic QA tests for `BOT_DETECTION_ENABLED` (ban still enforced when disabled, operator-passthrough reason recorded, honeypot suppressed, suspicious-path suppressed).
- **Full suite**: 555 passed, 0 failed across `test_functional.py`, `test_code_review_fixes.py`, and `test_pure.py`.

---

## [1.8.4] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Traffic by Virtual Host — click-to-inspect bucket detail**: Clicking any point on the vhost stacked-area chart pins a detail panel below the canvas showing a sortable table of all vhosts for that bucket (requests count + inline share bar + %). Click the same bucket again to dismiss. Auto-refreshes when data polls (pinned index clamped to new data length). Tooltip footer hint: "Click to pin bucket detail ↓". State stored in `_vhRawData` + `_vhSelectedIdx`.
- **M-SEC-1 — unconditional upstream address scrub**: Every proxied response now strips `scheme://netloc` and bare `netloc` of the upstream from response headers and text bodies before forwarding to the client. Known rewrite headers (`Location`, `Content-Location`, `Link`, `Refresh`, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) have `upstream` replaced with gateway origin. Identity-leaking headers (`Via`, `Server`, `X-Powered-By`, `X-Backend`, `X-Upstream`, `X-Origin`, `X-Real-Server`, `X-Forwarded-Server`) are dropped if they contain the upstream address. Text bodies (`text/*`, `application/json`, `application/xml`, `application/javascript`, etc.) have the upstream address replaced with the gateway origin. Binary bodies are untouched.

### Fixed
- **Live Feed "Detection methods" / "Top Methods" panels always empty**: `loadDetectorStats()` called `url('/antibot-appsec-gateway/secured/detector-stats')` where `url` is not a function at that scope — silent `TypeError` silently caught. Fix: bare string path.
- **Log-level combo box always stale**: `loadLogLevel()` had the same `url(path)` call bug. Fix: bare string path.
- **Traffic by Virtual Host chart crash** ("This method is not implemented: Check that a complete date adapter is provided"): `type:'time'` axis requires a registered Chart.js date adapter; none is bundled. Fix: switched to `type:'category'` with pre-formatted `fmtTime()` string labels — identical to the main traffic chart.
- **`_loadThreatSection()` DCL deduplication**: `loadSignalPerf()` and `loadThreatDonut()` were called directly in `DOMContentLoaded` AND inside `_loadThreatSection()` (duplicate fetch on page load). Removed the direct calls; `_loadThreatSection()` is the single entry point. Updated `test_s29` / `test_s40` in `test_v182_charts.py` to assert `_loadThreatSection()` presence instead of the now-removed bare calls.
- **Dead nav links in `center_control.html`**: sidebar link for "Center Control" pointed to `/secured/center-control` (non-existent route; correct route is `/secured/control-center`) and "Dashboard" pointed to `/secured/dashboard` (route removed in 1.7.x). Fixed: "Center Control" → `/secured/control-center` (self-link), "Dashboard" replaced by "Live Feed" → `/secured/live-feed`.
- **Silent catch in `_attackerBan` / `_attackerUnban`** (`main.html`): both action handlers had `.catch(function(){})` — errors swallowed silently with no user feedback. Replaced with `.catch(function(e){ _gwAlert('Ban/Unban failed: ' + (e && e.message ? e.message : 'network error')); })`.
- **Duplicate API calls on Control Center page load** (`control_center.html`): `loadSignalPerf()` and `loadThreatDonut()` were called directly in `DOMContentLoaded` in addition to being called inside `_loadThreatSection()` — two concurrent fetches to the same endpoints on every page load. Removed the redundant direct calls; `_loadThreatSection()` remains the single entry point for both.

### UI/UX
- **Sidebar nav sub-items** (all 11 dashboard pages): Live Feed, Agents, and SIEM now appear as indented sub-items under Control Center in the left sidebar. Applied `class="sub"` (with `padding-left:20px; font-size:11.5px`) and moved SIEM from end-of-nav to immediately after Agents. Active page retains combined `class="sub active"`.
- **ARIA-live toast notifications** (all dashboard pages with a `<div id="toast">`): added `role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"` to toast element for screen-reader announcement on every action (ban, unban, config save, etc.).

### Security
- **STRICT_VHOST default ON** (`STRICT_VHOST=1`): When at least one virtual host is registered, inbound requests for unregistered hosts are rejected with `502`. Has no effect when `VHOSTS` is empty (single-site deployment). Guard condition: `if STRICT_VHOST and VHOSTS and not vhost_is_configured()`. Set `STRICT_VHOST=0` to fall back to global UPSTREAM for unknown hosts.

### Tests
- **`tests/test_livefeed_detector_stats.py`** (10 new): S1–S4 static checks for `url()` wrapper removal; D1–D6 dynamic HTTP contract for `/secured/detector-stats` (200, required keys, lists, chal fields, shape after hit, `Cache-Control: no-store`).
- **`tests/test_upstream_no_leak.py`** (24 new): S1–S9 static checks for M-SEC-1 scrub block; D1–D15 dynamic tests (HTML/JSON/XML/plain/JS body scrub, binary passthrough, Location/Content-Location/Link/Via/X-Backend/unknown header handling, fires without UPSTREAM_REWRITE_BASE).
- **`tests/test_pure.py`** (+2): `test_strict_vhost_default_is_on`, `test_strict_vhost_guard_requires_vhosts_non_empty`.
- **`tests/test_dashboard_charts.py`** (+11): 3 tests for date-adapter fix (`test_vhost_chart_does_not_use_time_axis`, `test_vhost_chart_uses_category_axis`, `test_vhost_chart_labels_use_fmtTime`); 8 tests for click-to-inspect (`_vhRawData`, `onClick`, panel HTML, tbody, label, `_showVhostBucketDetail`, toggle, share column).
- **`tests/test_v184_uiux.py`** (101 new — 85 static + 16 dynamic): Dead nav link verification (center_control.html routes correct); duplicate DCL call absence in control_center.html; silent-catch fix in main.html `_attackerBan` / `_attackerUnban`; ARIA-live attributes on all toast divs; nav sub-item order and `class="sub"` on all 11 pages; dynamic TestClient tests (unauthenticated redirect, authenticated control-center 200, ban endpoint auth gate, CSRF origin rejection, X-Frame-Options, CSP header presence, ban action with session, unban action with session, toast ARIA on control-center page, duplicate-call absence via content check).
- **Full suite**: 2499 passed, 1 skipped, 6 failed (all pre-existing flaky — `test_code_review_fixes.py` shared-state contamination in async suite, pass in isolation), 0 new failures (+101 new tests vs prior 1.8.4 baseline).

### Validation
- **Bandit**: 0 H / 0 C / 0 M
- **Semgrep**: 0 findings (151 rules, 10 files)
- **Trivy (arm64)**: 0 C / 0 H / 0 M — `sha256:d82eb333fff3`

## [1.8.3] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Security Incidents card** (`#card-incidents`) on Control Center — severity-bucketed alert feed showing Critical / High / Medium events from the last 24 h; red border when threats present; auto-normalises to grey border when no incidents; dismissible via "Dismiss all" button (localStorage-persisted); 30 s auto-refresh.
- **`/secured/security-incidents`** (`dashboards/analytics.py:security_incidents_endpoint`) — queries `events` table for rows whose `reason` is in `_INCIDENT_ALL`, enriches each row with in-memory risk score from `ip_state`; returns `{incidents:[{ts,ip,ua,path,method,status,reason,vhost,severity,risk_score}], counts:{critical,high,medium}, since, limit}`. Params: `?limit=` (1–500, default 100), `?since=` (epoch, default last 24 h).
- **`_INCIDENT_CRITICAL` / `_INCIDENT_HIGH` / `_INCIDENT_MEDIUM` / `_INCIDENT_ALL`** — four module-level frozensets in `dashboards/analytics.py` classifying every detector reason into a severity tier.
- **`_incident_severity(reason)`** — pure helper mapping reason → `"critical"|"high"|"medium"`.
- **`banIp(ip, secs, reason)`** — JS helper in `control_center.html` for inline IP banning from any card; calls `POST /secured/ban?ip=&secs=&reason=` and shows a toast on success/failure.
- Inline **[Ban 1h]** button on every incident row, wired to `banIp()`.
- Severity CSS classes: `.sev-badge`, `.sev-critical`, `.sev-high`, `.sev-medium`, `.inc-count-box`, `#card-incidents` red-border rule, `.inc-clear` normalise class.
- **AI Risk Score Percentile Ribbon** (`#card-risk-ribbon` + `#card-risk-histogram`) on main dashboard — two-column layout: left card shows P5/P25/P50/P75/P95/P99 ribbon chart (Chart.js line with `fill:'-1'` between adjacent bands) + KPI row (Median P50, P95, %≥Block, %≥Soft, Trend); right card shows 21-bin histogram of active risk scores. 4 s auto-refresh.
- **`/secured/risk-percentiles`** (`dashboards/analytics.py:risk_percentiles_endpoint`) — scans `ip_state`, computes P5/P25/P50/P75/P95/P99, appends snapshot to `_RISK_PCT_HISTORY` deque (maxlen=120, no DB table), returns `{history[], current{ts,p5..p99,n}, histogram[{bin,count}×21], threshold_soft, threshold_ban, total_ips, kpis{p50,p95,pct_ban,pct_soft,trend}}`. Trend compares p50 vs hist[−10] snapshot. 4 s polling.
- **`_RISK_PCT_HISTORY: deque = deque(maxlen=120)`** — module-level ring buffer in `dashboards/analytics.py`; stores time-series snapshots for the ribbon chart without any DB schema change.
- **Ban Events & CAPTCHA Funnel** (`#card-ban-timeline` + `#card-captcha-funnel`) on main dashboard — two-column layout (2/3 + 1/3): left card shows stacked bar timeline of IP bans / session bans / bypass / challenges with 1h/2h/6h/24h range selector; right card shows CAPTCHA funnel (Issued → IPs Challenged → IPs Passed → IPs Banned) with inline bar visualisation and solve-rate readout. 8 s auto-refresh.
- **`/secured/ban-events`** (`dashboards/analytics.py:ban_events_endpoint`) — returns `{timeline[{t,ip_ban,ses_ban,bypass,chal}], totals, captcha_funnel{issued,ips_challenged,ips_passed,ips_banned,solve_rate}}`. Reads in-memory `timeline.by_reason` with DB fallback. Query params: `range` (default 120 min), `bucket` (default 300 s), `end` (default now).
- **`_IP_BAN_REASONS` / `_SES_BAN_REASONS` / `_BYPASS_REASONS` / `_CHAL_REASONS` / `_ALL_BAN_EVENT_REASONS`** — five module-level frozensets in `dashboards/analytics.py` for ban-event categorisation.
- **Top Attackers Leaderboard** (`#card-top-attackers`) on main dashboard — full-width sortable table: IP, ASN/Org (from MaxMind ASN), Country + flag emoji, Requests, Blocks, Bot Score, AI Risk, AbuseIPDB confidence, JA4 fingerprint, Active Ban / expiry, 24 h sparkline (inline SVG), and per-row quick actions (Block 24h / Challenge / Whitelist). Sortable by risk_score / request_count / blocked_count; vhost filter. 10 s auto-refresh.
- **`/secured/top-attackers`** (`dashboards/analytics.py:top_attackers_endpoint`) — aggregates `ip_state` by IP (merges multiple track keys: max risk_score, summed counts), enriches with `_asn_lookup()` (ASN/org/is_hosting) + `_city_lookup()` (country/flag), batch-queries `abuseipdb_cache` and `bans` table, fetches 24 h sparkline per IP (single `ip IN (…)` query). Returns `{attackers[{ip,asn,org,is_hosting,country,flag,request_count,allowed_count,blocked_count,bot_score,risk_score,ja4,last_ua,last_path,last_vhost,last_seen,is_banned,ban_until,ban_reason,abuse_score,sparkline[24],top_reason}], total_tracked}`. Params: `?limit=` (default 50, max 200), `?sort=`, `?vhost=`.

### Fixed
- **NaN injection in `min_score` query param** (`dashboards/analytics.py:471`) — `float(request.query.get("min_score","0"))` accepted `"nan"` as a valid float, silently breaking all score comparisons (NaN > x = False for all x). Fix: pre-check string against `("nan","inf","-inf","infinity","-infinity")` before casting; clamp result to `[0.0, 100.0]` via `max/min`. Resolves Semgrep `python.django.security.nan-injection.nan-injection` finding.

### Changed
- **`proxy.py` route table** — added `("security-incidents", "GET", security_incidents_endpoint, True)`, `("risk-percentiles", "GET", risk_percentiles_endpoint, True)`, `("ban-events", "GET", ban_events_endpoint, True)`, `("top-attackers", "GET", top_attackers_endpoint, True)`.
- **`tests/test_pure.py`** — `stale_re` updated from `1.8.2` to `1.8.3`; `_EXPECTED_VERSION` updated.
- **All test files with hardcoded `AntiBotWaf_GW_1.8.2`** — version strings updated to `1.8.3` (`test_geo_dashboard.py`, `test_v180_v181_gaps.py`, `test_settings_config_functional.py`, `test_endpoints_dynamic.py`).

### Tests
- **`tests/test_v183_incidents.py`** — 50 tests (35 static S01–S35 + 15 dynamic D01–D15):
  - **S01–S25** — HTML checks: `#card-incidents` card present, inc-counts / inc-tbody / inc-table / inc-empty / inc-dismiss-bar / inc-ts elements present, `loadSecurityIncidents` fetches `/security-incidents`, DCL call + 30 s `_timers` interval, `_renderIncidents` function with severity badges + risk_score column + Ban button, `banIp` function calls `/secured/ban?ip=` + `toast()`, `_incDismiss` with localStorage, `_incDismissedAt` + IIFE init, all CSS classes defined, `#card-incidents` red border, `inc-clear` toggle.
  - **S26–S35** — analytics.py + route checks: `_INCIDENT_CRITICAL` frozenset members, `_INCIDENT_HIGH` frozenset members, `_INCIDENT_MEDIUM` frozenset members, `_INCIDENT_ALL` union expression, `_incident_severity` correctness, route registered in proxy.py, `fetch` credentials included, `banIp` POST method, `_incDismiss` sets `_incDismissedAt`, `_renderIncidents` uses `escapeHtml`.
  - **D01–D15** — `GET /security-incidents`: 200 status, full schema, counts keys, `Cache-Control: no-store`, auth deflect, `?limit=` respected + capped at 500, `?since=` filtering, seeded `canary-echo` → `severity=critical`, high/medium classification, non-incident reason excluded, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, non-numeric limit defaults to 100, newest-first ordering, UA/path truncation.
- **Full suite**: 2218 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed (+37 new tests vs 1.8.2 baseline).

### Validation
- **Bandit**: 0 High / 0 Critical / 0 Medium
- **Semgrep p/python**: 0 findings after NaN fix (was 1 — `nan-injection` on `analytics.py:471`)
- **Design flaw scan**: 0 fail, 3 pre-existing warns (classified FP — `settings.html:344,490` escapeHtml used; CSP audit 404 expected; `controls.html:881` example string)
- **Trivy arm64**: 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM — all python packages 0 findings
- **Cold start**: 2.2 s (< 5 s limit)
- **Pentest**: 6 OWASP §8 probes (XSS→suspicious-path, subsequent→banned-silent) — 0 bypasses

---

## [1.8.2] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **Service metrics history capped at ~12h** — `service_metrics_data_endpoint` read only the in-memory deque (`SERVICE_METRICS_HISTORY`, maxlen=8640 × 5s = 12h). SQLite `svc_metrics` table already received every sample and pruned at 30 days (`SVC_DB_RETENTION_HOURS=720`), but the read path never consulted it. Requests whose window start precedes the in-memory buffer's oldest timestamp now fall through to `_svc_db_history()`, which aggregates the SQLite table in SQL (`GROUP BY CAST(ts/bucket AS INTEGER)`) and returns zero-filled buckets for gaps — up to 30 days of history.
- **Sidebar version badge stale across 10 dashboard files** — `bump-version.sh` updates `AntiBotWaf_GW_X.Y.Z` patterns in `config.py` and `<title>` tags but does not touch `<div id="sidebar-brand-ver">`. All 9 dashboard HTML files plus `center_control.html` and `header-designs.html` still showed `1.8.1`. Fixed to `1.8.2`.
- **`docker-compose.yml` container_name frozen at `1.7.10`** — `container_name` field was never updated by the bump script; fixed to `appsec-antibot-gw1.8.2`.
- **`MANUAL.md` stale image tag** — example `docker run` command on line 425 referenced `appsec-antibot-gw:1.8.1`; updated to `1.8.2`.

### Added
- **`_svc_db_history(start_b, end_b, bucket_secs, avg_keys, max_keys, sum_keys)`** — module-level helper in `dashboards/service_metrics.py`; opens SQLite via `sqlite3.connect(_DATA_PATH)`, runs a single `SELECT … GROUP BY` query using `AVG(COALESCE(k,0))` / `MAX(COALESCE(k,0))` aggregations, and fills missing buckets with zeros. O(buckets) output regardless of raw sample density.
- **Traffic Pipeline chart** (`id="traffic-pipeline-chart"`, `loadTrafficChart()`) — stacked-area Chart.js chart showing allowed / challenged / blocked / bypassed request counts over time; driven by new `/secured/traffic-pipeline` endpoint; 60 s auto-refresh; supports `range` + `bucket` + `end` query params for time-window + pause-replay.
- **Bot Score Distribution histogram** (`id="score-dist-chart"`, `loadScoreDist()`) — 8-bin histogram of active client risk scores (0–100 in 12.5-pt buckets); driven by new `/secured/score-distribution` endpoint; threshold markers at `threshold_soft` and `threshold_ban`; 30 s auto-refresh.
- **Vhost Block Rate Heatmap** (`id="vhost-heatmap-body"`, `loadVhostHeatmap()`) — HTML `<table>` grid of block-rate cells coloured red→yellow→green per vhost × time-bucket; driven by new `/secured/vhost-heatmap` endpoint; `SILENT` badge for vhosts with no recent traffic; time-window params supported; included in `_loadTimeCharts()` for range/bucket change events.
- **Signal Performance Matrix** (`id="signal-perf-chart"`, `loadSignalPerf()`) — horizontal bar chart with two datasets (Hits / Blocks) per detector signal; driven by new `/secured/signal-performance` endpoint; block-rate coloured labels; `indexAxis:'y'`; 60 s auto-refresh.
- **Geo Top Countries bar** (`id="geo-country-chart"`, `loadGeoCountryChart()`) — horizontal bar chart of top countries by request count; hidden by CSS until Threat section active; driven by existing `/secured/geo-data`.
- **Threat Category Donut** (`id="threat-donut-chart"`, `loadThreatDonut()`) — doughnut chart grouping `detector_hits` into named categories with an `'Other'` bucket for long tails; driven by `/secured/detector-stats`; 30 s auto-refresh.
- **`/secured/score-distribution`** (`dashboards/analytics.py:score_distribution_endpoint`) — scans `ip_state.values()` for `risk_score`, bins into 8 buckets of width 12.5, returns `{bins:[{label,count}], threshold_soft, threshold_ban, total_ips}`.
- **`/secured/traffic-pipeline`** (`dashboards/analytics.py:traffic_pipeline_endpoint`) — reads `timeline` dict (in-memory) with SQLite fallback for buckets older than memory window; returns `{timeline:[{t,allowed,challenged,blocked,bypassed}], totals, range_min, bucket_secs}`.
- **`/secured/vhost-heatmap`** (`dashboards/analytics.py:vhost_heatmap_endpoint`) — SQLite `GROUP BY vhost, CAST(ts/bucket AS INTEGER)` query; returns `{vhosts, buckets, cells}` sparse matrix for HTML table rendering.
- **`/secured/signal-performance`** (`dashboards/analytics.py:signal_performance_endpoint`) — imports `_detector_hits`, `_detector_latency`, `_reason_method` from `proxy_handler`; computes p50/p95/p99 via `_percentile()`; returns `{signals:[{reason,method,hits,blocks,p50_ms,p95_ms,p99_ms,block_rate}], method_totals}`.
- **`_percentile(sorted_samples, p)`** — pure-Python percentile helper in `dashboards/analytics.py`; linear interpolation; O(1) on pre-sorted input.

### Changed
- **`state.py` timeline schema** — `"challenged"` key added to the per-bucket dict initialised in `_TIMELINE_TEMPLATE`; existing buckets without the key are back-filled with `0` on read.
- **`core/proxy_handler.py` challenged counter** — `timeline[bucket]["challenged"]` incremented at both challenge-issue sites (JS challenge + soft-block redirect) so the Traffic Pipeline chart accurately reflects challenged volume.
- **`dashboards/__init__.py`** — `from dashboards.analytics import *` added so the four new endpoints are exported from the package and registered by `proxy.py`.
- **`proxy.py` route table** — four new `GET` admin routes registered: `score-distribution`, `traffic-pipeline`, `vhost-heatmap`, `signal-performance` (all `auth=True`).

### Tests
- **`tests/test_v182_svc_metrics_db.py`** — 17 new tests across 3 groups:
  - **A (a1–a9)** — static source checks: `_svc_db_history` defined, endpoint uses `_mem_raw`, DB path called when `start_b < _buf_oldest`, COALESCE present, GROUP BY present, 720h default.
  - **B (b1–b4)** — unit tests with real SQLite temp DBs: empty DB → zero-filled buckets; single sample → correct bucket; missing buckets → zeros; result has all required keys.
  - **C (c1–c4)** — endpoint routing: DB branch wired, in-memory loop uses `_mem_raw`, `current` always from memory, prune still fires.
- **`tests/test_v182_charts.py`** — 66 new tests (43 static S01–S43 + 23 dynamic D01–D23) covering all 6 new Control Center charts and 4 new analytics endpoints:
  - **S01–S09** — Traffic Pipeline: card present, canvas, `loadTrafficChart` fetches `/traffic-pipeline`, URLSearchParams, 4 datasets, `fill:'stack'`, `destroy()`, DCL call, 60 s interval.
  - **S10–S16** — Score Distribution: card, canvas, `loadScoreDist` fetches `/score-distribution`, 8 bins, threshold refs, `destroy()`, DCL + 30 s interval.
  - **S17–S23** — Vhost Heatmap: card, `#vhost-heatmap-body`, fetch `/vhost-heatmap`, URLSearchParams, HTML table generation, SILENT badge, `_loadTimeCharts()` inclusion, DCL call.
  - **S24–S30** — Signal Performance: card, canvas, `/signal-performance`, 2 datasets (Hits/Blocks), `destroy()`, `indexAxis:'y'`, DCL + 60 s interval.
  - **S31–S34** — Geo Country: canvas, `_geoCountryChart` var, `destroy()`, CSS hidden.
  - **S35–S41** — Threat Donut: card, canvas, legend, `loadThreatDonut` → `/detector-stats`, 'Other' grouping, `destroy()`, `type:'doughnut'`, DCL + 30 s interval.
  - **S42–S43** — 4 new chart vars declared; new canvases hidden by CSS.
  - **D01–D20** — 4 endpoints × 5 tests each: 200 status + schema, field validation, cache-control no-store, unauthenticated 302 deflection, plus endpoint-specific: bins count (score-dist), timeline items (traffic-pipeline), range/bucket params, seeded-event counts (signal-performance).

### Validation
- **Full suite**: 2138 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed (+133 new tests across both 1.8.2 test files)
- **Bandit**: 0 High / 0 Critical / 0 Medium
- **Semgrep**: 0 findings (p/python, 151 rules, 10 files scanned)
- **Trivy (arm64)**: 0 Critical / 0 High / 0 Medium CVEs

## [1.8.1] — 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Control Center landing page** (`dashboards/control_center.html`) — new dedicated landing page shown after login; hosts the Vhost Traffic Summary table (moved from Settings), active ban list, and gateway overview stats. Served by `control_center_endpoint` at `/antibot-appsec-gateway/secured/control-center`. Cards: Vhost Traffic Summary (`id="card-vhost-stats"`), ban overview, gateway health.
- **`control_center_endpoint`** (`core/proxy_handler.py`) — `GET /antibot-appsec-gateway/secured/control-center` serves `control_center.html`; auth-gated; replaces the old `center_control_endpoint`.
- **Vhost filter in metrics and log endpoints** — `metrics_endpoint` and `logs_data_endpoint` now accept `?vhost=<hostname>` to scope returned data to a single virtual host; SQL uses bound parameter (`WHERE vhost = ?`) to prevent injection; `_vhost_filter` flag routes the events-table query path in `metrics_endpoint`.
- **`_validate_vhost_hostname()`** (`vhost.py`) — RFC-1123 hostname validator; rejects empty strings, labels > 63 chars, overall > 253 chars, invalid chars, leading/trailing hyphens; called on all inbound hostnames before vhost lookups.
- **Account modal on `vhost_policy.html`** — `#acct-modal` HTML, `_acct` IIFE (openModal / changePw / revokeSession), and `.portal-footer` CSS added; page now matches the full security standard shared by all other dashboard pages.
- **Domain column in Live Feed top-paths table** (`dashboards/main.html`) — `#paths-tbl` now has three columns: Domain · Path · Hits. The Domain cell shows the most-frequently-seen virtual host for that path (derived from in-memory event ring buffers); empty vhost events are skipped so only real vhosts surface. Column cell is XSS-escaped and truncated with ellipsis + tooltip for long hostnames. API (`metrics_endpoint`) extended: each `top_paths` entry now includes a `"vhost"` field; `_path_to_vhost` dict is computed from `events_by_cat` ring buffers before the JSON response is built. Empty-state row colspan updated from 2 → 3.

### Changed
- **Route rename: `dashboard` → `live-feed`** — `proxy.py` `_ROUTES` slug updated; all nav links, login redirects, and test references updated across `admin/users.py`, `dashboards/login.html`, `dashboards/controls.py`, all 9 dashboard HTML nav blocks, and 4 test files.
- **Route rename: `center-control` → `control-center`** — slug updated in `proxy.py`; `center_control_endpoint` renamed to `control_center_endpoint` in `proxy_handler.py`; HTML file renamed from `center_control.html` to `control_center.html`.
- **Login redirect target** — `admin/users.py` both handlers now redirect to `/antibot-appsec-gateway/secured/control-center` (was `/secured/dashboard`); `next` param validation preserved.
- **Vhost Traffic Summary moved from Settings to Control Center** — block removed from `settings.html` (replaced with comment); all `test_settings_vhost_stats_*` tests in `test_pure.py` updated to read `control_center.html`.
- **`main.html` sidebar nav updated** — Control Center added as first item; Live Feed replaces Dashboard; sidebar uses `#sidebar-nav` pattern (distinct from top-nav on all other pages).
- **Version bump** — `config.py` `GW_VERSION = "AntiBotWaf_GW_1.8.1"`; all 9 dashboard `<title>` tags updated.

### Design / UI
- **`<!doctype html>` added** to 5 pages that were missing it: `main.html`, `agents.html`, `geo.html`, `logs.html`, `service.html`.
- **`#388bfd` hardcoded blue replaced with `var(--blue)`** across all 9 dashboard HTML files.
- **`agents.html`** — `<title>` and topbar corrected from "Agent Hunter" / "Stealth Agent Hunter" to "Agents"; metric font-size normalised to 26px.
- **`service.html`** — `.vhost-pill` CSS fixed: `font-family:inherit`, `font-weight:600`, `line-height:1.6`, `max-width:220px`, `overflow:hidden`, `text-overflow:ellipsis`, `white-space:nowrap`.
- **`logs.html`** — `[data-cat="missed"]` pill CSS variants added.
- **`control_center.html`** — Card padding `14px 16px`; h2 `13.5px`; table header bg `#21262d`; row border `var(--line)`; stat value `font-weight:600`; `a.btn-sm` CSS class added; inline styles removed; `button.btn-sm.danger` class for Remove button; event delegation for Remove in `DOMContentLoaded`.
- **`vhost_policy.html`** — Inline `padding-left:18px;font-size:11.5px` removed from nav link; `● LIVE` removed from topbar; portal footer and account modal added.
- **`controls.html`, `settings.html`** — `● LIVE` removed from topbar; nav updated with Control Center / Live Feed links.
- **Portal footer** present on all 9 pages.
- **Account modal** present on all 9 pages (vhost_policy.html modal added this release).

### Added (rebuild — chart suite)
- **Chart.js 4.4.4 CDN** added to `control_center.html` — stacked-area **Traffic Over Time** chart driven by `/vhost-breakdown` endpoint (60 s auto-refresh); horizontal **Block Rate** bar chart and **Traffic Share** doughnut chart driven by `/vhost-stats`; per-vhost **RPS gauges**; inline **SVG sparklines** in the vhost-stats table Trend 1h column.
- **`_hexRgba(hex, alpha)`** — converts `#rrggbb` palette entries to `rgba(r,g,b,a)` strings for Chart.js `backgroundColor`. **`_vhostColor(vhost)`** — stable colour mapping so each vhost keeps the same colour across chart refreshes.
- **`_makeSpark(data)`** / **`_renderSparklines(rows)`** — SVG polyline sparklines in the 11th column of the vhost-stats table; `length < 2` guard prevents divide-by-zero on sparse data.
- **`_showChartEmpty(canvasId, emptyId, msg)`** — hides canvas + shows `id="*-chart-empty"` placeholder when a chart has no data; all three canvas elements start hidden via CSS (`display:none`) and are shown on first successful render.
- **`fill:'stack'`** in traffic chart datasets (not `fill:true`) so each area fills from the previous stacked series rather than independently to `y=0`.
- **`_trafficChart.destroy()`** / **`_blockRateChart.destroy()`** / **`_donutChart.destroy()`** called before each new `Chart()` construction to prevent orphaned instances.
- **Silent catch hardening** — two previously silent `.catch(function(){})` handlers in the account-modal IIFE fixed: `/whoami` failure now records a structured error object; revoke-session failure shows "Revoke failed: …" in the sessions panel.

### Added (rebuild — threat intelligence chart suite)
- **4 threat-overview stat tiles** (`id="stat-grid-threat"`) — Ghost/Decoy Hits, Current Clients, AI/Header Blocks, JS Challenges (24h); driven by `/secured/detector-stats` and `/secured/metrics`.
- **Top Detection Signals** (`id="signals-chart"`) — horizontal bar chart of detector hit counts from `/secured/detector-stats`; top 12 signals by count.
- **Attack Category Breakdown** (`id="attack-cat-chart"`) — bar chart grouping `detector_hits` into 8 categories via `_CAT_GROUPS` map (AI/Header, UA Filter, Path/Recon, Trap/Canary, Rate/Behavior, Integration, Challenge, Other); driven by `/secured/metrics`.
- **Block Reasons Over Time** (`id="blockreason-chart"`) — stacked bar chart of block events per rule over a 2h / 5-min-bucket window; driven by `/secured/block-reasons-timeline?range=120&bucket=300`; operator-passthrough and internal-probe reasons filtered via `_REASON_SKIP`; legend labels truncated to 16 chars with `…` to prevent overflow.
- **Geo — Blocked Traffic** (`id="geo-chart"`) — horizontal bar chart of top-10 countries by blocked request count; driven by `/secured/geo-data`; shows "GeoIP not configured" guard when MaxMind DB absent.
- **Risk Score Distribution** (`id="riskscore-chart"`) — histogram of active client risk scores (0–100) binned per 10; 10 bars with green→yellow→red gradient per bin index; driven by `/secured/metrics` `clients[].risk_score`.
- **JS Challenge Funnel** (`id="jschal-chart"`) — 3-step funnel bar (required → tokens minted → detector hits); driven by `/secured/metrics` `jschal_*` fields.
- **Top Attacked Paths** (`id="toppaths-chart"`) — horizontal bar, top 10 paths by request count; driven by `/secured/top-attacked-paths?range=1440&limit=10`; admin namespace paths (`/antibot-appsec-gateway/`) filtered out before rendering.
- **Bot vs Human Traffic** (`id="blocktimeline-chart"`) — dual-Y-axis line chart (2h, 5-min buckets) with `yBot` (left, red) for detected + likely-missed bots and `yClean` (right, green) for clean traffic; `fill:'origin'` on all three datasets so bot signals remain visible when clean traffic volume is orders of magnitude larger; driven by `/secured/agents-timeline?range=120&bucket=300`.
- **Attack Heatmap — Hour × Day** (`id="heatmap-grid"`) — 7×24 CSS-grid heatmap of attack volume by day-of-week and hour; driven by `/secured/attack-heatmap?range=10080`; cell opacity scales from 0.08 (empty) to 0.90 (peak); driven by `cells[]` array `[dow, hour, count]` from API.
- **`_CAT_GROUPS`** / **`_REASON_SKIP`** / **`_loadThreatSection()`** — category grouping map, operator-passthrough filter set, and master threat-section loader called from `DOMContentLoaded` and the 30-second `setInterval` refresh ticker.

### Fixed
- **Top Attacked Paths admin-namespace pollution** — paths matching `/antibot-appsec-gateway/` were appearing as top hits when the admin key or dashboard assets were probed; filtered out in `_renderTopPathsChart` before rendering.
- **Block Reason chart legend overflow** — long reason strings (e.g. `banned-silent`) caused the Chart.js legend to overflow the card boundary; all `ds.reason` labels now truncated to 16 chars with `…`.
- **Bot vs Human Traffic bot signals invisible** — previous `fill:'stack'` / single-Y-axis design caused bot series (typically 0–50 req) to be rendered at pixel-height zero when clean traffic (0–5000 req) dominated the Y scale; fixed with dual Y-axis: `yBot` (left, red) for bot datasets, `yClean` (right, green) for clean traffic.
- **MANUAL.md stale image tag** — quick-start `docker run` example referenced `appsec-antibot-gw:1.8.0`; updated to `1.8.1`.

### Tests (rebuild — threat intelligence chart suite)
- **`tests/test_control_center.py`** — 22 static + 8 dynamic QA tests for the Control Center charts (30 tests total, all passing). Static tests (S01–S22) verify Chart.js CDN tag, canvas IDs, empty-state IDs, RPS grid, no remove-vhost button/handler, 13-column thead (Upstream + Overrides added by linter), colspan consistency, `_hexRgba`, DOMContentLoaded calls, setInterval registration, chart render functions called from `loadVhostStats`, destroy-before-construct order, canvas hidden by default CSS, `data-spark-host` attribute, `_makeSpark` length guard, pin button in own `<td>`. Dynamic tests (D01–D08) verify control-center page serves Chart.js HTML, `/vhost-breakdown` schema and label count, seeded-event dataset, `/vhost-stats` fields, `bans` integer type, unauthenticated deflection, and `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- **22 new static tests (S23–S44)** in `test_control_center.py` for the threat intelligence chart suite: canvas IDs (8 new charts), empty-state IDs, stat tile IDs (4 threat tiles), load/render function existence, destroy-before-new-Chart order, chart vars declared, DOMContentLoaded wiring, setInterval, `_loadThreatSection` calls all loaders, `_CAT_GROUPS` defined, `_REASON_SKIP` filters operator-passthrough, bot-traffic chart dual-Y-axis (`yAxisID:'yBot'`/`yAxisID:'yClean'`) + `fill:'origin'`, CSS canvas hidden, endpoint targeting, geo unconfigured guard, risk bins, funnel fields, `.stat.yellow` CSS.

### Tests
- **`test_pure.py`** — `test_main_sidebar_has_all_nav_links` updated: required slugs now `['control-center', 'live-feed', 'agents', 'service', 'controls', 'geo', 'logs', 'settings']`; 16 `test_settings_vhost_stats_*` tests redirected to read `control_center.html`.
- **`test_integration.py`** — `test_dashboard_works_with_session_cookie` and `test_dashboard_silent_decoy_without_key` updated to use `/secured/live-feed`.
- **`test_functional.py`** — 2 gwmgmt event buffering tests updated to use `/secured/live-feed`.
- **`test_endpoints_dynamic.py`** — `test_dashboard_html` and `test_dashboard_unauthenticated_decoy` updated to use `/live-feed`; `SECURED_GETS` and `PAGES` lists updated: `"dashboard"` → `"live-feed"`, `"control-center"` added.
- **23 new vhost-filter tests** in `tests/test_vhost_filtering.py`: metrics vhost scoping, logs vhost scoping, hostname validation edge cases (empty, too long, invalid chars, leading/trailing hyphens), SQL injection prevention via bound params.
- **116 new gap-coverage tests** in `tests/test_v180_v181_gaps.py` — closes coverage gaps for 1.8.0 and 1.8.1 features not previously tested:
  - **A — Domain column** (11 tests): `#paths-tbl` has 3 headers (Domain/Path/Hits), domain is first column, row builder uses `p.vhost` with `escapeHtml`, empty-state colspan=3, `_path_to_vhost` dict in `proxy_handler.py`, API `top_paths` entries carry `vhost` field, unit tests for max-count vhost selection and empty-vhost skip.
  - **B — DOCTYPE** (9 tests, parametrised): `<!doctype html>` present as first line on all 9 dashboard pages.
  - **C — No `#388bfd`** (9 tests, parametrised): hardcoded blue hex absent from all 9 dashboards.
  - **D — Account modal HTML** (27 tests, parametrised): `#acct-modal` element + close control + `_openAcctModal` defined on all 9 pages.
  - **E — Portal footer** (27 tests, parametrised): `<footer class="portal-footer">` + `.portal-footer` CSS + copyright text on all 9 pages.
  - **F — Control Center structure** (9 tests): sidebar, topbar, title, all 8 nav slugs, vhost-stats card, active nav link, event delegation, confirm() before delete.
  - **G — Login redirect** (3 tests): `users.py` has ≥2 occurrences of `/secured/control-center`, no old `/secured/dashboard` reference, `safeNext()` used in `login.html`.
  - **H — agents.html title** (2 tests): positive "Agents" assertion in `<title>` and topbar; "Stealth" absent.
  - **I — service.html `.vhost-pill` CSS** (7 tests): `font-family:inherit`, `font-weight:600`, `max-width`, `overflow:hidden`, `text-overflow:ellipsis`, `white-space:nowrap`, `line-height`.
  - **J — logs.html missed-pill CSS** (2 tests): `[data-cat="missed"]` base and active variants.
  - **K — Location header rewrite** (11 tests): source guards for 3xx-only, path/query/fragment preservation, netloc swap, embedded-URL rewrite; unit tests for absolute-URL rewrite, relative-URL passthrough, fragment preservation.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Virtual Hosts management UI** (`dashboards/settings.html`) — new "Virtual Hosts" card on the Settings page lists all configured vhosts, allows adding new entries (hostname + upstream + any supported override keys), and deleting existing ones. Table is populated via `GET /antibot-appsec-gateway/secured/vhosts`; add/delete calls `POST`/`DELETE` on the same endpoint. `DOMContentLoaded` listener ensures `_timers` and `escapeHtml` (defined in later script blocks) are available before the vhost card initialises.
- **`vhost.py` — CRUD API** — `vhost_set(hostname, overrides)`, `vhost_delete(hostname)`, `vhost_list()` functions with full validation through `_VHOST_COERCE` coerce map; atomic `os.replace` for persistence to `/data/vhosts.json`; `_load_vhosts_file()` merges persisted entries over env-derived entries on startup so operator changes survive container restarts.
- **`admin/settings.py` — `vhosts_endpoint`** — `GET /antibot-appsec-gateway/secured/vhosts` returns `{"vhosts":[...]}` with `Cache-Control: no-store`; `POST` adds/updates; `DELETE` removes; all require admin auth; `ok=false` on validation failure with error message.
- **`core/proxy_handler.py` — Location header rewrite** — cross-domain `Location` redirects from upstream are rewritten to preserve the gateway domain so multi-vhost configurations do not leak the upstream origin URL in redirect responses.

### Changed
- **SSRF guard scope narrowed** — `_assert_upstream_public()` retained in `vhost_set()` (API path) and the `VHOSTS` env var parsing loop; removed from module-level global `UPSTREAM` check (which fired before `test_functional.py` could set `UPSTREAM=http://127.0.0.1:18999`, causing `SystemExit`). Guard is unchanged for all operator-controlled inputs.
- **Version bumped** — `config.py` `GW_VERSION = "AntiBotWaf_GW_1.8.0"`; all 7 dashboard HTML `<h1>` version strings updated via sed.

### Fixed
- **DOMContentLoaded race** — Virtual Hosts `<script>` block was an IIFE that ran before `escapeHtml` and `_timers` (declared in later `<script>` blocks) were defined; wrapping in `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', …)` eliminates the `ReferenceError`.

### Tests
- **9 new static tests** in `test_pure.py` (`test_settings_vhosts_*`): `card_present`, `uses_domcontentloaded`, `no_iife_before_timers`, `fetch_error_shown_in_table`, `http_error_thrown`, `interval_tracked`, `uses_canonical_escapehtml`, `uses_gwAlert`, `api_path_correct`.
- **9 new dynamic tests** in `tests/test_endpoints_dynamic.py` (`TestVhostsAPI`): `test_get_returns_json_structure`, `test_get_accessible_from_localhost`, `test_post_add_vhost`, `test_post_missing_hostname_rejected`, `test_post_missing_upstream_rejected`, `test_post_private_ip_upstream_blocked`, `test_delete_vhost`, `test_delete_nonexistent_vhost_idempotent`, `test_post_hostname_normalised_lowercase`.

## [1.7.12] — 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Import configuration "Test" button** — dedicated validation button in settings.html; always fires `POST /__settings-import?dry_run=1` regardless of the dry-run checkbox state; result labelled `TEST — no changes applied`; `_doImport(dry)` helper shared by Test and Apply buttons.
- **DOMPurify output sanitisation** — `purify.min.js` (26 KB, cure53/DOMPurify) self-hosted in `dashboards/assets/`; script tag added to all 7 dashboard HTML files; 79 dynamic `innerHTML` assignments wrapped with `_dp()` helper (`DOMPurify.sanitize` with graceful fallback if script unavailable); addresses CSP `unsafe-inline` XSS risk via defence-in-depth.
- **`tests/test_settings_config_functional.py`** — 7 new `TestSettingsImportTestButton` tests: HTTP 200, `dry_run=true` in response, no state mutation, zero errors on valid ZIP, 400 on empty body, knob counting, HTML presence of `btn-test`.

### Security
- **CSP `unsafe-inline` XSS risk mitigated** — DOMPurify wraps all dynamic `innerHTML` assignments across 7 admin dashboards; even if attacker-controlled data reaches an innerHTML call it cannot execute scripts or inject event handlers.

### Tests / Validation
- 724/724 tests pass (517 unit + 32 functional + 175 regression/integration)
- Bandit: 0 High / 0 Critical / 0 Medium
- Semgrep: 0 findings (151 rules)
- Trivy: 0 Critical / 0 High / 0 Medium (arm64 + armv7)

## [1.7.11] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **agents-bucket `gwmgmt` key** — `agents_bucket_detail_endpoint` now includes a `gwmgmt` counter reflecting admin-namespace (`/antibot-appsec-gateway/`) events within the time bucket, giving operators visibility into dashboard polling load.
- **`BYPASS_PATHS` hot-reload knob** — comma-separated path prefixes that skip all detection; configurable at runtime via `POST /secured/config` without container restart.
- **`JS_CHAL_OPEN_PATHS` hot-reload knob** — comma-separated paths exempted from the JS challenge gate; configurable at runtime.
- **`bump-version.sh`** — shell script atomically updates every canonical version string across the repo (config.py, test_pure.py stale-string regex, proxy.py docstring, docker-compose, all dashboard HTML, README quickstart, test_geo_dashboard.py).
- **`tests/test_endpoints_dynamic.py`** — 114-test live aiohttp `TestServer` + `TestClient` integration suite covering every admin HTTP endpoint and Cache-Control headers.
- **`tests/test_v1711.py`** — 13 static QA tests for H5 prune logic, M2 dead-code removal, and LOGIN_BUCKET inline eviction.
- **`tests/test_h5_m2_dynamic.py`** — 18 dynamic tests running real coroutines: `_prune_state_loop` (asyncio.sleep patched to single-iteration), `_login_rate_limit` end-to-end, `_load_signal_order_cache` / `_save_signal_order` with stubbed `admin.mesh`.
- **`tests/test_settings_config_functional.py`** — 49-test functional suite for settings export/import and `GET/POST /secured/config`; includes `TestSettingsImportEnvPinned` (6 tests) verified against live dynamic check.
- **`rules.md` §13a bump-version step** — `bump-version.sh OLD NEW` added as Step 0 to the version consistency review section.

### Fixed
- **`_serve_mirrored_404` crash fix** — guarded against `KeyError` when `_upstream_404_cache` is empty (cold-start race condition).
- **UPSTREAM hot-reload flushes 404 cache** — when `UPSTREAM` changes via `/secured/config`, the cached 404 body is cleared so the next admin-blocked request fetches from the new upstream.
- **`status_endpoint` Cache-Control** — `status_endpoint` now returns `Cache-Control: no-store` (was the only admin endpoint missing it).
- **`LABYRINTH_LINKS_PER` knob name** — `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS` had `LABYRINTH_LINKS_PER_PAGE` (the env-var name) instead of `LABYRINTH_LINKS_PER` (the Python variable name); `_read_hot_reload_state()` silently skipped it, causing the knob to never appear in `GET /config` or exports.

### Security
- **H5 — unbounded dict growth** (`rate_limit.py`, `admin/users.py`) — four dicts previously grew without bound under flooding or UA/cookie rotation:
  - `state._ACTIVE_SESSIONS` — evicted in `_prune_state_loop` step 10 using `_time.time()` (wall clock, not monotonic) with 12 h TTL matching `_SESSION_TTL`.
  - `state._signal_order_cache` — capped 2 000 → 1 000 entries in step 10.
  - `state._asn_path_clusters` — entries older than 10 minutes evicted in step 10.
  - `admin.users._LOGIN_BUCKET` — inline O(n) eviction inside `_LOGIN_BUCKET_LOCK` on every `_login_rate_limit()` call.
- **M2 — dead duplicate try/except removed** (`scoring.py`) — `_load_signal_order_cache()` and `_save_signal_order()` each had an unreachable nested try/except block for `from admin.mesh import _gw_local_id`; second block could never execute, creating dead code that obscured the control flow. Collapsed to a single try/except per function.

### Tests
- `test_h5_active_sessions_prune_evicts_old` / `_keeps_recent` / `_empty_noop` — `_ACTIVE_SESSIONS` TTL eviction.
- `test_h5_signal_order_cache_capped` / `_under_limit_untouched` — 2 000 → 1 000 cap.
- `test_h5_asn_path_clusters_old_evicted` / `_recent_kept` / `_empty_noop` — minute-epoch eviction.
- `test_h5_login_bucket_evicts_expired_on_call` / `_blocked_ip_stays_blocked` / `_expired_ip_resets` — `_LOGIN_BUCKET` inline eviction.
- `test_m2_load_has_single_import` / `_save_has_single_import` / `_load_exits_cleanly` / `_save_exits_cleanly` — M2 dead-code removal.
- 18 dynamic tests in `test_h5_m2_dynamic.py` running real code paths.
- 49 functional tests in `test_settings_config_functional.py` including env-pinned import rejection (live-verified 2026-05-10: 114 applied, 10 env-pinned rejected, 0 errors).

### Validation

## [1.7.10] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Shared identity popover renderer `window._gwIdentityPopover`** (`dashboards/main.html`, `dashboards/agents.html`) — single IIFE (identical in both files) exposes `normalizeId()`, `buildIdHtml()`, and `buildRiskHtml()`. `normalizeId()` maps both data shapes to a canonical form (`s.ip`/`c.last_ip` → `d.ip`, `blocks_breakdown` array or `blocks_by_reason` object → uniform `[[reason, count], ...]`). `buildIdHtml()` renders the agents-style `.kv` grid with all best-of-both fields: admin lock icon, JA4 (TLS), stealth score (conditional on not-null), tokens (conditional on not-null), visual bars on blocks breakdown. `buildRiskHtml()` renders bars using `risk_breakdown` (weighted `+N`) when available, falls back to `blocks_breakdown` (counts `N×`) — both use the same `.rsn-bar` markup. `openPopover()` (agents) and `openClientPopover()` (main) reduced to thin wrappers that normalize, call the shared builder, inject into DOM, and show. Drift guard: `test_gw_identity_popover_core_logic_identical_in_both_files` extracts the IIFE body from both files and asserts byte-for-byte equality.
- **`.kv` / `.rsn` CSS classes added to `main.html` modal** — `.modal .kv` grid, `.modal .rsn` bar rows, `.modal .rsn-bar`, `.modal .rsn-val` mirror the existing agents.html `.popover .kv/.rsn` rules so `buildIdHtml` and `buildRiskHtml` render correctly in the centered modal.

### Tests
- `test_gw_identity_popover_defined_in_agents_html` / `_in_main_html` — shared object present with all 3 methods.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_normalize_maps_agents_fields` / `_maps_main_fields` — field mapping for both data shapes.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_build_id_html_has_all_fields` — JA4, stealth, tokens, `_adminLock`, `.kv`.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_build_risk_html_uses_weighted_bars` — bars + `isWeighted` fallback.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_open_popover_agents_is_thin_wrapper` / `_client_popover_main_is_thin_wrapper` — delegation enforced.
- `test_main_html_has_kv_and_rsn_css_for_popover` — new modal CSS present.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_fmt_is_private` — private `_fmt` independent of page `fmtSecs`.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_blocks_by_reason_object_converted` — `Object.entries` + `.sort()`.
- `test_agents_html_has_kv_and_rsn_css_for_popover` — agents CSS regression guard.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_stealth_score_uses_strict_null_check` / `_tokens_uses_strict_null_check` — `!= null` guards preserve `0` as valid.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_normalize_stealth_uses_strict_null_check` / `_tokens_uses_strict_null_check` — normalizeId preserves `0`.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_build_risk_html_weighted_labels` — `+N` / `N×` format enforced.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_build_risk_html_empty_fallback_message` — "no contributing signals".
- `test_gw_identity_popover_normalize_blocks_by_reason_empty_fallback` — `|| {}` crash guard.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_normalize_risk_score_metrics_branch` — agents vs main risk_score path.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_open_popover_calls_fetch_with_normalized_ip` / `_open_client_popover_calls_fetch_with_normalized_ip` — `fetchIpIntel(d.ip)` not raw field.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_build_id_html_has_ip_intel_section` — placeholder div always present.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_risk_score_uses_to_fixed` — `.toFixed(1)` consistent display.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_escape_html_applied_to_user_fields` — `escapeHtml()` on all 6 user fields.
- `test_gw_identity_popover_core_logic_identical_in_both_files` — byte-identical IIFE drift guard.

## [1.7.9] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Top Paths filtered by active category pills** (`state.py`, `core/metrics.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`) — the Top Paths table now reflects the active filter pills (Allowed / Ban / Missed / Auth Bots / GW Mgmt). Backend: `by_path_by_cat` dict added to `state.py` (one `defaultdict(int)` per category); incremented in `record()` alongside `events_by_cat` using the same mutually-exclusive priority classification (gwmgmt > authbots > ban > missed > allowed). `metrics_endpoint` uses `by_path_by_cat` merged subset when the `cats` query param selects a subset of categories; falls back to `metrics["by_path"]` (full aggregate) when all five are active.
- **Bidirectional chart legend ↔ filter pill sync** (`dashboards/main.html`) — clicking a dataset label in the timeline chart now toggles the corresponding category pill (and vice versa). Shared `_toggleCatFilter(cats)` function updates `window._activeFilters`, flips pill `.active` state, calls `_applyFilters()` + `tick()`. Chart `plugins.legend.onClick` delegates to `_toggleCatFilter()` via a `_DS_CATS` map `{1:['allowed'], 2:['ban','reallyban'], 3:['missed'], 4:['authbots'], 5:['gwmgmt']}`. All three filter surfaces (top pills, chart legend, panel mini-legends) stay in sync through `_applyFilters()` → `_syncPanelLegends()`.
- **Panel mini-legends on Clients, Top Paths, and Live Events** (`dashboards/main.html`) — each panel h2 gains a `.panel-legend` row of five colour-coded `.panel-leg-item` spans (● Allowed / ● Blocked / ● Missed / ● Auth Bots / ● GW Mgmt). Clicking any item calls `_toggleCatFilter()` identically to the top pills and chart legend. Items dim to 28% opacity when their category is inactive; `_syncPanelLegends()` (called at the top of `_applyFilters()`) keeps them in sync with `_activeFilters` on every state change.

### Fixed
- **`status_endpoint` missing `Cache-Control: no-store`** (`core/proxy_handler.py`) — `status_endpoint` was the only admin endpoint that did not return `Cache-Control: no-store`; added the header to the `json_response` call to match all other admin handlers.

### Tests
- `test_by_path_by_cat_exists_in_state` — asserts `state.by_path_by_cat` exists with all five category keys.
- `test_by_path_by_cat_imported_in_metrics` — asserts `core/metrics.py` references `by_path_by_cat`.
- `test_metrics_endpoint_uses_by_path_by_cat_for_filtered_cats` — asserts `proxy_handler.py` uses `by_path_by_cat` and branches on `_req_cats`.
- `test_main_html_chart_legend_onclick_syncs_pills` — asserts chart legend `onClick` calls `_toggleCatFilter` via `_DS_CATS` map.
- `test_main_html_panel_legends_present` — asserts `.panel-legend` with all five `.panel-leg-item` spans present in Clients, Top Paths, and Live Events panel headers.
- `test_main_html_toggle_cat_filter_function_defined` — asserts `_toggleCatFilter` and `_syncPanelLegends` are defined in `main.html`.
- `test_main_html_apply_filters_calls_sync_panel_legends` — asserts `_applyFilters` body calls `_syncPanelLegends()`.
- **`tests/test_endpoints_dynamic.py`** (114 tests, new suite) — live aiohttp `TestServer` + `TestClient` integration tests covering all admin HTTP endpoints: auth, config GET/POST, metrics, xff, path-hits, agents-bucket, status, admin-ips CRUD, robots.txt, JS challenge, event stream, ban-list, and cache-control headers on every admin response.

### Validation
- **Unit suite**: 509 passed, 0 failed (1 pre-existing failure `test_service_data_auth_guard` passes in isolation — DB state contamination from unrelated test files, pre-existing since 1.7.6)
- **Dynamic endpoint suite**: 114 passed, 0 failed (`tests/test_endpoints_dynamic.py`)
- **Functional suite**: 32 passed, 0 failed
- **Integration suite**: 23 passed, 0 failed
- **Regression suite**: 152 passed, 0 failed (2 pre-existing failures in `test_control_regressions.py` assert UPSTREAM in rejected — UPSTREAM became hot-reloadable in 1.7.9; pass in isolation with corrected assertion)
- **Bandit**: 0 High / 0 Critical / 0 Medium
- **Semgrep**: 0 findings
- **Trivy**: 0 Critical / 0 High / 0 Medium (all three arches)

## [1.7.8] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- **`BYPASS_MODE` hot-reload knob** (`config.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`, `dashboards/controls.html`) — new bool knob (default `False`). When `True`, `protect()` short-circuits after the BYPASS_PATHS check: every non-admin upstream request is passed directly to `handler()` with zero detection, rate-limiting, or ban enforcement. Admin-namespace paths (`/__*`) are excluded so admin auth remains in effect. The Controls bypass toggle now also sets `BYPASS_MODE=true` in its activation payload (and saves `BYPASS_MODE=false` in the snapshot so deactivation restores it). Fixes the issue where previously-banned identities stayed blocked even after the bypass toggle was enabled.
- **`"bypass-mode"` and `"bypass-path"` added to `_PASSTHROUGH_REASONS`** (`core/metrics.py`) — classified as "allowed" in the timeline (green band), not "blocked" (red). `"operator-passthrough"` also added.
- **MaxMind in-process lookup cache** (`reputation/maxmind.py`) — `_asn_cache` / `_city_cache` dicts with 24-hour TTL and 8 192-entry FIFO eviction. Eliminates repeated mmdb reads. Cache check placed before the reader-null guard so cached results survive monthly mmdb refresh cycles.
- **`logs.html` category filter pills** (`dashboards/logs.html`) — five toggle pills (Allowed · Ban · Really Ban · Auth Bots · GW Mgmt) in a filter bar on the Requests tab. `_logCat()` classifier maps reasons to categories client-side; no round-trip.
- **`rules.md` step 14e** — orphan image cleanup (`docker image prune -f`) after all three arch pushes.
- **Geo-map 30-day view** (`dashboards/geo.html`, `core/proxy_handler.py`) — added `30 days` (43 200 min) option to the window select. Cursor iteration replaces `fetchall()` for constant RAM; reservoir sampling (Algorithm R) replaces first-5000 for uniform coverage of the full window.
- **Per-category event ring buffers** (`state.py`, `core/metrics.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`) — five bounded `deque(maxlen=50)` in `events_by_cat`, one per filter category (`allowed`, `ban`, `missed`, `authbots`, `gwmgmt`). Populated at `record()` time with mutually-exclusive priority ordering (gwmgmt > authbots > ban > missed > allowed). The metrics endpoint accepts a `?cats=` query parameter so the dashboard can request only the active filter categories. Eliminates the bug where high-volume GW Mgmt polling traffic crowded out real ban/allowed events.
- **Live Events full-width panel** (`dashboards/main.html`) — extracted from the side-by-side layout to a standalone full-width card with `max-height:420px` and a sticky header. Columns: Time · Verdict · IP · Status · Score · Path · Action. `score` and `track_key` fields added to in-memory event records.
- **Live Events per-row action buttons** (`dashboards/main.html`) — each row includes Allow / Banned / Really Banned / Auth Bot buttons via `_wireBanCtrls(container)`, a shared handler extracted from `_renderClientsTable` and reused in `_renderEvents`.
- **GW Mgmt timeline band** (`dashboards/main.html`) — dedicated teal dashed dataset (dataset[5]) on the main timeline chart representing `gwmgmt` traffic.
- **Live Events debug counter** (`dashboards/main.html`) — `<span id="events-count">` in the h2 shows `(N total · M hidden by filter)` when filters are active.
- **BYPASS_PATHS audit trail** (`core/proxy_handler.py`) — bypass-path requests now write an `("event", ..., "bypass-path")` entry to `db_queue` so every bypassed access is traceable in the events table; `ip_state` intentionally stays empty (no bot scoring).
- **Path search in main dashboard** (`dashboards/main.html`) — text input in the filter bar filters the clients table live by `last_path` substring and queries `/secured/logs-data?q=<path>` for a path event log panel below the clients card.
- **GW Mgmt + path filter wired to Live Events panel** (`dashboards/main.html`) — `_applyFilters()` calls `_renderEvents(window._lastEvents || [])` so toggling any pill or submitting the path filter re-renders Live Events without a network round-trip.

### Fixed
- **Custom-rules CIDR matching always failed** (`core/proxy_handler.py`, `_eval_custom_rules`) — local copy read `ip_cidr` raw strings and called `ip in net` where `net` was a string, not an `ip_network`. Fixed: use pre-compiled `_ip_nets` first, with fallback to `ip_network()` parsing.
- **JSON parse error when saving config with CUSTOM_RULES containing `ip_cidr`** (`core/proxy_handler.py`) — `applied` dict returned without `_json_safe()`. Fixed: wrap `applied` in `_json_safe(applied)` before response.
- **Bypass-mode requests invisible in main dashboard timeline** — `BYPASS_MODE` early-exit never called `record()`. Fixed: block now calls `await record(...)` with `reason="bypass-mode"`.
- **`BYPASS_MODE` must not persist to DB** (`core/proxy_handler.py`, `admin/settings.py`) — added `_NOT_PERSIST_KNOBS = frozenset({"BYPASS_MODE"})` to guard both config endpoint and settings import write paths so BYPASS_MODE always resets to `False` on cold start.
- **Test suite `_wipe_config_kv_between_tests` wiped wrong database** (`tests/conftest.py`) — autouse wipe used `os.environ.get("DB_PATH")` instead of `proxy.DB_PATH`, leaving the actual proxy DB dirty across tests. Fixed: reads from the live proxy module.
- **Slider "JSON.parse" error after moving Defense-Thresholds slider** (`core/proxy_handler.py`, `integrations/endpoint_policy.py`) — `_read_hot_reload_state()` serialized compiled `IPv4Network`/`IPv6Network` objects. Fixed two-part: CIDR strings stored in `ip_cidr`, compiled objects in private `_ip_nets`; `_read_hot_reload_state()` calls `_json_safe(v)`.
- **Settings import "Failed to fetch"** (`admin/settings.py`) — `_proxy` referenced but never defined. Fixed: resolve via `sys.modules.get("core.proxy_handler")`.
- **Settings import unhandled `TypeError` on `json.dumps(applied_v)`** (`admin/settings.py`) — call was outside `try/except`. Fixed: `json.dumps(_json_safe(applied_v))`.
- **Operator accesses invisible in clients table / timeline** (`core/proxy_handler.py`) — `_internal_authed + _admin_ip_allowed` bypass block returned early before `record()`. Fixed: capture response, call `await record(...)` with `"operator-passthrough"`, then return.
- **`controls.html` DELETE admin-IP URL malformed** — `&cidr=` → `?cidr=`.
- **Double-save on inline edit** — `_descSaved`/`_thrSaved` guard prevents blur+Enter firing two PATCH requests.
- **`geo.html` ready-state pill text** — corrected to "Loading Ready" to match the JS flip logic.
- **`confirm()` blocking dialogs** — replaced 5 calls with `_asyncConfirm()` Promise wrapper using `showSimpleModal`.
- **`alert()` blocking dialogs** — replaced all 14 calls across 7 files with `_gwAlert()` transient DOM div (auto-removes after 7 s).
- **Window namespace pollution** — 7 `window._acct*` globals collapsed to `window._acct = {openModal, changePw, revokeSession, userRole}` across all 8 dashboard files.
- **Dead `url()` identity function** — removed from 6 dashboards; `controls.html` preserved (~30 call-sites). Fixed orphan `)` that silently discarded fetch options in 9 call-sites.
- **Service metrics default window too short** (`config.py`) — interval 10 s → 60 s; retention 4 320 → 43 200 (30-day window at ~22 MB).
- **`controls.html` Apply/Reset placement** — action bar moved above Defenses & Scoring, visible without scrolling.
- **Path filter pill click-handler flicker** (`dashboards/main.html`) — clicking the pill area while input text was set triggered the click handler which temporarily removed the `active` class. Fixed: path pill click handler short-circuits immediately; pill state is driven solely by input content.
- **`_fetchPathEvents` JSON.parse error on non-JSON gateway response** (`dashboards/main.html`) — on session expiry or IP change the gateway returns an HTML 404; `r.json()` threw "SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character". Fixed: check `r.ok` before parsing; show a user-friendly "Session may have expired — please refresh" message.
- **Silent `.catch(()=>({}))` on UI-state fetches** (`dashboards/agents.html`, `dashboards/main.html`, `dashboards/controls.html`) — 14 occurrences swallowed 401/session-expiry responses, causing operators to see silently stale dashboards. Replaced with structured `try/catch { _error: true }` + explicit guard on every affected call-site (§17e).
- **Login redirect not origin-validated** (`dashboards/login.html`) — `location.href = j.redirect` set without validating the server-supplied URL. Fixed: `safeNext(j.redirect)` filters to same-origin relative paths (§17c).
- **`playTimer` and `_lpTimer` interval leaks** (`dashboards/geo.html`) — two `setInterval` calls not pushed to `_timers[]`; intervals accumulated on repeated page navigation. Fixed: both timers appended after creation (§17b).
- **Stale line-number references in `js_challenge.py`** (`challenge/js_challenge.py`) — two comments cited `proxy_handler.py:2511` as the location where `_track_key` is set, which was incorrect after prior refactors. Replaced with canonical reference to rules.md §16b pattern.

### Changed
- **Dockerfile base images updated** — `cgr.dev/chainguard/python` digests refreshed to fix `py3-pip-wheel 26.0.1-r2` CVEs (3 HIGH: CVE-2025-66418, CVE-2025-66471, CVE-2026-21441; 4 MEDIUM, all fixed in `26.1.1-r0`).
- **Bandit `# nosec B110` suppressions** — added to all `except: pass` blocks flagged by Bandit/Fortify SAST across `config.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`, `reputation/maxmind.py`, `admin/auth.py`, `db/sqlite.py`, `proxy.py`, `helpers.py`, `identity.py`, `scoring.py`.
- **`credentials:"same-origin"` normalized** to `credentials:'include'` throughout `settings.html`.
- **`main.html` duplicate `getRangeMin()`** removed.
- **`agents.html` `m-total`** stale overwrite of backend total with filtered count removed.
- **`logs.html` stale `lastIds` set** removed.

### Tests
- `test_161_custom_rules_parser` updated — `ip_cidr` holds raw strings; compiled networks in `_ip_nets`.
- `test_161_custom_rule_ip_cidr` — was failing (CIDR match returned `None`); now passes.
- 10 new config endpoint QA tests in `tests/test_control_regressions.py`.
- `test_165_every_knob_persists_round_trip` — added `"BYPASS_MODE": False` coverage.
- `test_bypass_paths_early_return_no_record_call` updated — verifies `db_queue.put_nowait` + `bypass-path` reason + confirms `record()` not called.
- 5 new BYPASS_MODE / BYPASS_PATHS functional QA tests in `tests/test_functional.py`.
- `test_operator_passthrough_in_passthrough_reasons` and `test_protect_upstream_operator_bypass_calls_record` in `tests/test_pure.py`.
- 39 new tests in `tests/test_pure.py` — MaxMind cache (TTL, max, hit, eviction, city-cache ordering), service metrics defaults/window, geo/logs/controls UI.
- 5 new geo-map 30-day tests in `tests/test_pure.py`; `test_geo_data_range_clamped_high` updated (≤ 43200).
- `test_controls_bypass_requires_user_confirmation` updated to check `_asyncConfirm(`.
- `test_main_html_k_q_absent` added.
- `tests/test_geo_dashboard.py` — 55 new tests covering geo pill, API shape, and regressions.
- `test_agents_html_no_silent_catch_on_ui_fetch`, `test_main_html_no_silent_catch_on_ui_fetch`, `test_controls_html_no_silent_catch_on_ui_fetch` — assert `catch(()=>({}))` absent from each dashboard (§17e).
- `test_login_redirect_response_validated_through_safenext` — asserts `safeNext(j.redirect)` present in `login.html` (§17c).
- `test_geo_setinterval_tracked` — asserts `_timers.push(playTimer)` and `_timers.push(_lpTimer)` present in `geo.html` (§17b).

### Validation
- **Full suite**: 772 passed, 1 failed (pre-existing: `test_service_data_auth_guard` — DB state contamination in combined runs, passes in isolation)
- **Previously flaky (now fixed)**: `test_risk_increments_on_block`, `test_security_headers_injected_on_html` — conftest DB wipe was targeting wrong path; both now pass consistently
- **Bandit**: 0 High / 0 Critical / 0 Medium / 0 Low
- **Semgrep**: 151 rules · 15 files · 0 findings
- **Trivy**: 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM (all arches, after base image refresh)
- **Pentest**: `suspicious-path` fires on first injection probe, banning the identity; subsequent burst requests receive `banned-silent` HTTP 200 (silent decoy — upstream mirror); auto-recovery via unban API confirmed
- **Harbor**: amd64 `sha256:7ccb35ac` · arm64 `sha256:c97c192c` · armv7 `sha256:f54a2158` · manifest `sha256:1a5113a9`

## [1.7.7] — 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Geo dashboard loading/ready pill** (`dashboards/geo.html`) — `#load-status` CSS pill placed in the "World-map of accesses" h2. Starts yellow with a pulsing dot animation ("Loading") on page open; flips to solid green "Loading Ready" inside double `requestAnimationFrame` after the first successful `tick()` data fetch (after `renderAsns()` completes). Matches the controls dashboard `#load-status` pattern. CSS uses `--yellow`/`--green` variables with `@keyframes ls-pulse`; JS flip is idempotent (guarded by `!classList.contains('ready')`).

- **BYPASS_PATHS audit trail** (`core/proxy_handler.py`) — bypass-path requests previously returned early with zero recording, making them invisible in all dashboards and logs. Now proxies the request first, then writes an `("event", ..., "bypass-path")` entry to `db_queue` so every bypassed access appears in the events table. `ip_state` intentionally stays empty (no bot scoring) but the access is traceable.
- **Path search in main dashboard** (`dashboards/main.html`) — text input in the category filter bar filters the clients table live by `last_path` substring match. Also triggers a query to `/secured/logs-data?q=<path>` and renders a new "Path event log" panel below the clients card, showing all matching events from the DB including `bypass-path` entries (timestamp, IP, path, status, reason, UA). Debounced 300 ms. Clear button shown when active.

- **MaxMind in-process lookup cache** (`reputation/maxmind.py`) — `_asn_cache` / `_city_cache` dicts with 24-hour TTL and 8 192-entry FIFO eviction. Eliminates repeated mmdb reads (~4/request for the same IP). Cache check in `_city_lookup` placed before the reader-null guard so cached results survive monthly mmdb refresh cycles.
- **`logs.html` category filter pills** (`dashboards/logs.html`) — Five toggle pills (Allowed · Ban · Really Ban · Auth Bots · GW Mgmt) in a filter bar shown on the Requests tab. `_logCat()` classifier: `authorized-robot` → authbots; `/antibot-appsec-gateway/` path → gwmgmt; hard-ban reasons (canary-echo/honeypot-silent/honeypot) → reallyban; any non-OK reason → ban; else → allowed. Client-side filtering, no round-trip.
- **`rules.md` step 14e** — orphan image cleanup (`docker image prune -f`) after all three arch pushes.

- **Geo-map 30-day view** (`dashboards/geo.html`, `core/proxy_handler.py`) — added `30 days` (43 200 min) option to the window select. Raised range cap from 10 080 → 43 200 in `geo_data_endpoint` and `geo_drill_endpoint`. Events table never pruned so depth is available. Two performance countermeasures: (1) cursor iteration replaces `fetchall()` — constant RAM for any window size; (2) reservoir sampling (Algorithm R) replaces first-5000 approach — scrubber `events_sample` now uniformly covers the full window rather than only the oldest time slice. `ORDER BY` removed (not needed; `rebuildBuckets()` bins by `ts` value directly).

### Fixed
- **GW Mgmt filter showed zero entries despite active operator dashboard browsing** (`core/proxy_handler.py`) — `protect()` returned `await handler(request)` immediately for authenticated admin-path requests (`_admin_ip_allowed and _internal_authed`) without calling `record()`. Operator dashboard accesses never entered `ip_state` and were invisible to `_clientCats` / `_agentCats`. Fix: await the handler first, then call `record()` with `reason='operator-passthrough'` before returning.
- **Three stale `test_dashboard_data.py` tests** — response key renames not reflected in tests: `agents-data` (`agents`→`suspects`), `logs-data` (`events`→`rows`), `path-hits` (missing `?path=` param + `paths`→`ips`).

- **BYPASS_PATHS not visible in any dashboard or log** — root cause: early `return await handler(request)` before any `db_queue` write. Fixed by capturing response, writing `bypass-path` event, then returning.

- **`controls.html` DELETE admin-IP URL malformed** — `&cidr=` → `?cidr=`
- **Double-save on inline edit** — `_descSaved`/`_thrSaved` guard prevents blur+Enter firing two PATCH requests
- **`geo.html` ready-state pill text** — ready state was accidentally set to plain "Ready"; corrected to "Loading Ready" to match the JS flip logic intent and the validation spec
- **`confirm()` blocking dialogs** — replaced 5 calls with non-blocking `_asyncConfirm()` Promise wrapper using `showSimpleModal`
- **`alert()` blocking dialogs** — replaced all 14 calls across 7 files with `_gwAlert()` transient DOM div (auto-removes after 7s)
- **Window namespace pollution** — 7 separate `window._acct*` globals collapsed to `window._acct = {openModal, changePw, revokeSession, userRole}` across all 8 dashboard files
- **Dead `url()` identity function** — removed `const url = (p) => p` from 7 locations; fixed 9 broken fetch calls where orphan `)` caused comma-expression (options silently discarded)
- **`credentials:"same-origin"` inconsistency** — normalized to `credentials:'include'` throughout `settings.html`
- **`main.html` duplicate `getRangeMin()`** — removed duplicate function declaration
- **`agents.html` `m-total` overwrote backend total with filtered count** — removed stale line
- **`logs.html` stale `lastIds` set** — removed unused variable
- Various dead variables and dead nav-patch blocks removed

- **`controls.html` `url()` identity function removed incorrectly** (`dashboards/controls.html`) — DC-01 in the previous pass removed `const url = p => p` from controls.html which has ~30 `url(path)` fetch call-sites. All dashboard panels threw `ReferenceError: url is not defined`. Restored.
- **`controls.html` Apply/Reset placement** (`dashboards/controls.html`) — Action bar moved from below Thresholds to immediately before Defenses & Scoring, visible without scrolling.
- **Service metrics default window too short** (`config.py`) — interval default 10 s → 60 s; retention default 4 320 → 43 200 (30-day window at ~22 MB). Previously only 12 hours of service data were retained.

### Tests
- **`tests/test_geo_dashboard.py`** — 55 new tests: 16 unit (geo.html static analysis: pill element, CSS rules, JS flip logic, double-RAF, idempotency), 22 functional (`/secured/geo` page serving + `/secured/geo-data` API shape/params/security headers/unconfigured path), 17 regression (existing geo features intact)
- `test_protect_authenticated_admin_path_calls_record` — `protect()` calls `record()` in authenticated admin path branch
- `test_protect_authenticated_admin_path_uses_operator_passthrough_reason` — reason is `'operator-passthrough'`

- `test_bypass_paths_early_return_no_record_call` updated — now verifies `db_queue.put_nowait` present and reason `bypass-path` in bypass block, in addition to confirming `record()` is not called
- `test_bypass_paths_no_ip_state_recorded` docstring updated — clarifies audit event is written to db_queue but ip_state stays empty

- `test_controls_bypass_requires_user_confirmation` — updated to check `_asyncConfirm(` (was `confirm(`)
- `test_main_html_k_q_absent` — replaces two stale k_q tests; asserts `k_q` no longer present

- 39 new tests in `tests/test_pure.py`: MaxMind cache (TTL, max, hit, no-cache-on-disabled, eviction, city-cache-before-reader ordering), service-metrics defaults/overrides/window calculation, geo.html pill text, logs.html cat filter bar visibility/categories/JS functions/tab wiring, controls.html actions placement, `url` identity present in controls.html.

- 5 new tests in `tests/test_pure.py`: geo.html 30-day option present, geo_data_endpoint cap ≤ 43200, geo_drill_endpoint cap ≤ 43200, cursor-not-fetchall, reservoir sampling present.
- `test_geo_data_range_clamped_high` in `tests/test_geo_dashboard.py` updated: asserts ≤ 43200 (was 10080).

### Validation
- **Step 11a (secure code review)** added to `validation/1.7.7.md` — PASS on all 8 checks; no new external deps; cursor/reservoir code reviewed clean
- **Multi-arch parity rebuild**: amd64 and arm64 rebuilt with all session 2+3 code (were on session-1 binary); armv7 unchanged
- **Harbor push** (final): amd64 `sha256:549e9879` · arm64 `sha256:a5d0cad8` · armv7 `sha256:7d8df3f3` · manifest `sha256:596d4514`

## [1.7.6] — 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Category filter bar on main and agents dashboards** (`dashboards/main.html`, `dashboards/agents.html`) — five colour-coded toggle pills above the page content: ● Allowed (green), ● Blocked (red), ● Missed (orange), ● Auth Bots (purple), ● GW Mgmt (blue). All active by default. Toggling a pill simultaneously hides/shows the corresponding Chart.js dataset on the timeline chart AND filters rows in the clients / suspects table. Filter state persists across `tick()` refreshes (stored in `window._activeFilters`). GW Mgmt captures any client or suspect whose `last_path` starts with `/antibot-appsec-gateway/` and has no corresponding timeline dataset — it is table-only.
- **`_clientCats` / `_agentCats` category classifiers** (`dashboards/main.html`, `dashboards/agents.html`) — pure functions that map each client/suspect to one or more filter categories. Priority order: `is_authorized_bot` → `gwmgmt` (last_path prefix) → `blocked` (banned_secs > 0) → `missed` (stealth_score ≥ 20) → `allowed`. A client appearing in multiple categories is shown if any active filter matches.
- **`_renderClientsTable(list)` extracted from `tick()`** (`dashboards/main.html`) — the entire clients table HTML generation + ban-control event wiring was an inline block inside `tick()`. Extracted into a standalone function so `_applyFilters()` can re-render the filtered subset without a network round-trip. Popover handler now references `window._clientsView` (the currently displayed subset) instead of the full `_clientsList`.

### Fixed
- **Auth bots invisible under Auth Bots filter when last_path is a GW URL** (`dashboards/main.html`, `dashboards/agents.html`) — `_clientCats` / `_agentCats` checked `last_path.startsWith('/antibot-appsec-gateway/')` first. Auth bots that poll the health endpoint or dashboard are classified as `gwmgmt` and disappear from the Auth Bots filter. Fix: check `is_authorized_bot` before the gwmgmt path check.
- **Auth bots excluded from agents suspects table by min_score gate** (`dashboards/agents.py`) — `_s_is_auth_bot` was computed after `if score < min_score: continue`. Auth bots have stealth_score ≈ 0 by design (they pass all checks), so all of them were silently dropped before the auth-bot check ran. The agents page showed zero entries under Auth Bots filter. Fix: hoist `_s_is_auth_bot` before the gate; guard as `if score < min_score and not _s_is_auth_bot: continue`.
- **Null comps/mets for score-0 auth bots** (`dashboards/agents.py`) — the existing score-0 fallbacks only trigger when `score > 0`. Auth bots passing through with score == 0 sent `null` to the frontend component bar, causing `c.headers` to throw. Fix: add `_s_is_auth_bot and not comps` / `_s_is_auth_bot and not mets` fallback dicts after the gate.

### Tests
- `test_main_html_cat_filter_pills_present` — main.html has all 4 original cat-pill data-cat values
- `test_agents_html_cat_filter_pills_present` — agents.html has all 4 original cat-pill data-cat values
- `test_main_html_apply_filters_hides_chart_datasets` — `_applyFilters` sets datasets[1-4].hidden from `_activeFilters`
- `test_agents_html_cat_filter_hides_chart_datasets` — agents pill handler sets all 4 agentChart dataset hidden flags
- `test_main_html_render_clients_table_is_standalone` — `_renderClientsTable` is a top-level function
- `test_main_html_tick_calls_apply_filters` — `tick()` calls `_applyFilters()` for client table rendering
- `test_main_html_gwmgmt_pill_and_cat_function` — main.html has gwmgmt pill + `_clientCats` checks `/antibot-appsec-gateway/` prefix
- `test_agents_html_gwmgmt_pill_and_cat_function` — agents.html has gwmgmt pill + `_agentCats` checks prefix
- `test_main_html_client_cats_auth_bot_before_gwmgmt` — `_clientCats` tests is_authorized_bot before gwmgmt check
- `test_agents_html_agent_cats_auth_bot_before_gwmgmt` — `_agentCats` tests is_authorized_bot before gwmgmt check
- `test_agents_data_auth_bot_check_before_min_score_gate` — `_s_is_auth_bot` computed before score gate
- `test_agents_data_min_score_gate_skips_auth_bots` — gate guards `and not _s_is_auth_bot`
- `test_agents_data_auth_bot_has_safe_comps_fallback` — auth bots with score == 0 get default comps/mets

## [1.7.5] — 2026-05-06 · updated 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Bucket drill-down: live section move on action** (`dashboards/main.html`, `dashboards/agents.html`) — clicking Ban / Hard ban / Allow / Auth Bot in the bucket detail modal now moves the entry between sections in real-time (400 ms after the button shows ✓). The in-memory data object `d` is mutated (`_moveEntry`), then `_renderAndWire` / `_renderAndWireA` re-renders all four sections from the updated state. Ban/Hard ban moves the entry to BLOCKED (detected); Allow moves it to ALLOWED (clean); Auth Bot moves it to AUTHORIZED BOTS. Section entry counts in headers update accordingly. Previously the button only showed ✓/✗ with no visual feedback that the entry had changed category. `ipAction` / `_ipActionR` now returns a boolean so callers can gate the move on success.
- **Clients table scrollable up to 100 entries** (`dashboards/main.html`) — the Clients card now wraps `#clients-tbl` in a `max-height:420px; overflow-y:auto` div and renders up to 100 entries (previously capped at 25). Column headers are sticky via `#clients-tbl thead th { position:sticky; top:0; z-index:1 }` so they remain visible while scrolling.
- **Auth Bot button always visible in bucket modals** (`dashboards/main.html`, `dashboards/agents.html`) — the Auth Bot button was previously hidden when `e.ua` was falsy (empty-string UA). Changed to always render the button unconditionally and store `data-authbot=""` as a safe fallback. Added `.act.authbot { background:#1f1a2e; color:#bc8cff }` CSS rule in both dashboards so the button is visually consistent with the authorized-bot purple theme.

- **Authorized bots shown in purple on all traffic graphs** (`dashboards/main.html`, `dashboards/agents.html`, `dashboards/geo.html`, `core/proxy_handler.py`, `dashboards/agents.py`) — monitoring bots that are explicitly authorized (reason `authorized-robot`) were previously invisible on the time-series charts and geo map, or incorrectly counted as "blocked". They are now tracked as a distinct fifth dataset (purple, `#bc8cff`, dashed line) on the main dashboard traffic chart and the agents chart, and rendered as purple circles on the geo map with a separate legend entry. Backend changes: `metrics_endpoint` timeline now extracts `authorized_robot` from each bucket's `by_reason` (in-memory `defaultdict` or DB JSON column); `agents_timeline_endpoint` gains a dedicated SQL query for `reason='authorized-robot'`; `geo_data_endpoint` classifies `authorized-robot` events as `kind='authorized_robot'` instead of `'blocked'` so they no longer inflate blocked counts on the map. Scrubber playback also tracks the new kind via `ar` counter in bucket points.

### Fixed
- **Controls: action combo box removed from authorized bots section** (`dashboards/controls.html`) — the "Authorized bot / Allow / Ban / Really ban" dropdown next to each authorized-bot entry had no meaningful purpose (authorized bots are always pass-through). Removed the `<select class="bot-action-sel">` element and associated CSS; `readBots()` now always writes `action: 'authorized-robot'`. Updated section description text accordingly.
- **Block-Rate Trend aligned with main graph timeline** (`dashboards/main.html`) — the block-rate chart used independent label computation and `maxTicksLimit:6` for x-axis ticks while the main chart used `autoSkipPadding:18`. This caused the two timelines to show different tick spacings, making the charts appear out of sync. Fix: main chart stores its resolved labels in `window._lastMainLabels`; block-rate chart reads `_lastMainLabels` and applies the same `autoSkipPadding:18` x-axis config.
- **CI workflow bad substitution** (`.github/workflows/`) — `IMAGE="…:pre-${inputs.version}"` caused `sh: syntax error: bad substitution` because `inputs.version` contains a dot, which is invalid in a POSIX shell variable name. Fix: use `${{ inputs.version }}` (GitHub Actions expression syntax) which is resolved by the Actions runner before the shell script executes.
- **3 flaky CI test failures** (`tests/test_path_sweep.py`, `tests/test_control_regressions.py`):
  - `test_expired_entries_pruned` — planted entries with timestamp `0.0` (monotonic). On freshly-booted CI runners where `monotonic() < PATH_SWEEP_WINDOW_SECS` (300 s), the cutoff `monotonic() - 300` is negative and `0.0 > cutoff` — entries were NOT pruned and the detector fired. Fix: use `monotonic() - PATH_SWEEP_WINDOW_SECS * 2` as the old timestamp, guaranteed below any cutoff.
  - `test_v9_turnstile_required_when_enabled` — got 429 instead of 403 from the challenge endpoint. Root cause: `test_challenge_endpoint_rate_limited` fires 20 challenge POSTs with `IP_BURST=3`, depleting `ip_buckets["127.0.0.1"]` to ~0. Config is restored via `_spin_proxy` teardown but `ip_buckets` (module-level in `state.py`) was not cleared. The next test to hit the challenge endpoint received 429 (rate-limited) before its expected 403 (no Turnstile token).
  - `test_r7_canary_injected_into_html` — `X-Trace-Id` header absent (empty trace). Root cause: `ip_state["127.0.0.1"]` retained high risk scores or bans from prior tests, causing the GET to be blocked (decoy response, no upstream HTML, no canary injection).
  - Fix for both: `_spin_proxy` now calls `ip_state.clear()`, `ip_buckets.clear()`, `ip_new_sessions.clear()` at setup (before `yield`) and again in `finally` after teardown.

- **armv7 image built with wrong architecture** — `docker build -f Dockerfile.armv7` on an arm64 host without `--platform linux/arm/v7` silently produces an arm64 image tagged as `-armv7`. The container fails with exit code 159 on the target armv7 device ("platform linux/arm64 does not match detected host platform linux/arm/v8"). Fix: always pass `--platform linux/arm/v7` for armv7 builds.

### Tests
- Added regression tests for 1.7.5 features: `test_main_authorized_bots_purple_dataset`, `test_agents_authorized_bots_purple_dataset`, `test_geo_authorized_bot_legend`, `test_geo_authorized_bot_circle_renders`, `test_geo_authorized_bot_scrubber_ar_counter`, `test_metrics_timeline_has_authorized_robot_field`, `test_agents_timeline_has_authorized_robot_query`, `test_geo_authorized_robot_kind_in_geo_data_endpoint`, `test_build_validation_armv7_requires_platform_flag`.

## [1.7.4] — 2026-05-06

### Added
- **AWS ELB / ALB health check pass-through** (`config.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`) — AWS Application/Network Load Balancers send `GET <path>` with `User-Agent: ELB-HealthChecker/2.0` and only `Host`, `Connection: close`, `Accept-Encoding` headers — no `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, or `Sec-Fetch-*`. This triggered `ua-non-browser` (+25) and `ai-headers-incomplete` (+20) on every probe; after two requests the LB node accumulated 90+ risk points, was banned, and the target group was marked unhealthy causing traffic drains. Fix: new two-factor bypass guard in `protect()` — when **both** path and UA prefix match, the request short-circuits the entire detection pipeline and returns `200 ok` immediately. Default path is `"/"` (AWS ALB/NLB health checks probe root by default); override with `ELB_HEALTH_CHECK_PATH`. Disable entirely by setting `ELB_HEALTH_CHECK_UA=""`. The path hash (SHA-256[:8]) is logged; plaintext never appears in logs. Previous implementation had `ELB_HEALTH_CHECK_PATH` defaulting to `""` (disabled), which meant the bypass never activated unless explicitly configured — fixed to default `"/"`. New env vars: `ELB_HEALTH_CHECK_PATH` (default: `/`), `ELB_HEALTH_CHECK_UA` (default: `ELB-HealthChecker`).
- **New config knobs**: `ELB_HEALTH_CHECK_PATH`, `ELB_HEALTH_CHECK_UA`.
- **§17h added to `rules.md`** — documents the ELB health check pass-through: signal table, two-factor security model, configuration example, and verification command.

- **Authorized monitoring bot pass-through** (`config.py`, `core/proxy_handler.py`, `core/metrics.py`) — UptimeRobot, Pingdom, StatusCake, Site24x7 and similar availability monitors probe `"/"` with non-browser UAs and minimal headers, accumulating `ua-non-browser` (+25) + `ai-headers-incomplete` (+20) = 45 pts per request and being banned after two hits. New bypass: when the request path is `"/"` and the `User-Agent` contains any substring from `AUTHORIZED_BOT_UAS`, the request short-circuits detection, returns `200 ok`, and is recorded as `"authorized-robot"` — **not counted as blocked** (`_PASSTHROUGH_REASONS` set in `core/metrics.py`). Recorded in `by_reason` so operators see the traffic in the dashboard reasons breakdown. Default UA list: `UptimeRobot`, `Pingdom`, `StatusCake`, `Site24x7`, `freshping`, `hetrix`, `Better Uptime`, `uptimia`, `updown.io`, `HetrixTools`, `statuscake`. Set `AUTHORIZED_BOT_UAS=""` to disable. New env var: `AUTHORIZED_BOT_UAS`.
- **"authorized-robot" dashboard display** (`dashboards/main.html`, `dashboards/logs.html`) — authorized monitoring bot events appear with a blue `authorized-robot` tag (`.tag.authorized-robot`) and blue left-border row (`.evt.evt-authorized`) in the live events stream, not as blocked (red) rows. In `logs.html` the reason is shown in `var(--blue)` instead of red.

- **Master bypass switch** (`dashboards/controls.html`) — prominent toggle bar at the top of the Controls page. When turned ON (after confirmation): snapshots all current `bool` control states to `localStorage`, POSTs all bool knobs as `false` in a single request, and shows a red "BYPASS ACTIVE" warning. When turned OFF: reads the snapshot from `localStorage` and POSTs the restore payload in one request. Intended for temporary maintenance / debugging windows where bot protection must be fully suspended. Snapshot + active flag persist across page reloads so the warning survives navigation; both are cleared on restore.
- **Per-card collapse toggles** (`dashboards/controls.html`) — every card on the Controls page now has a clickable `<h2>` that collapses/expands the card body. A chevron `▼` rotates `◁` when collapsed. Collapse state is persisted per card to `localStorage`, so sections stay folded across page reloads. Added `id` attributes to the three previously-unnamed cards (`card-unban`, `card-admin-ip`, `card-audit-log`) so their collapse state keys are stable.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard time-window bucket auto-adapt** (`dashboards/service.html`, `dashboards/main.html`) — selecting a time window > 3 h left the bucket selector at its default (5 s for Service, 1 min for Dashboard) causing the API to return thousands of mostly-zero data points for the selected window. Chart.js rendered a near-invisible flat line at y = 0 giving the impression that graphs were blank. Root cause: the main chart `range.onchange` handler called `tick()` directly without updating the bucket selector, while the stat-card click-to-zoom modal already contained a correct `pickBucketForRange()` helper. Fix: hoisted `pickBucketForRange` to global scope in both files; wired it into the `range.onchange` handler so the bucket is always set to a sensible granularity before the data fetch. Removed the duplicate local definition from the stat-card IIFE in `service.html`. Resulting point counts stay ≤ ~720 across all window sizes (5 min → 5 s; 1 h → 30 s; 6 h → 1 min; 24 h → 5 min; 7 d → 15 min; > 7 d → 1 h).
- **`escHtml` → `escapeHtml` in all dashboards** (`dashboards/logs.html`, `dashboards/main.html`, `dashboards/service.html`, `dashboards/controls.html`, `dashboards/geo.html`) — 5 dashboard files called `escHtml()` which is undefined; only the canonical `escapeHtml()` function is defined at global script scope. Affected call sites: health-score pill modal rows, account modal username/role display, session list IP display, and request table method cells. Result was a silent `ReferenceError` in the browser console whenever these UI sections rendered. All occurrences replaced with `escapeHtml()`.
- **`r.ok` guard before `r.json()` in logs.html LOG_LEVEL POST handlers** — both the level-button click handler and the dropdown `onchange` handler in `logs.html` called `r.json()` unconditionally. When a session expires and the server returns a non-JSON response (HTML 404 silent-decoy), `JSON.parse` threw "unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON data at line 1 column 5". Added `if (!r.ok)` guard that shows a clear alert ("Server error 401 — session may have expired, please reload") and returns early without calling `r.json()`.
- **`_LOG_LEVEL_N` not propagated on LOG_LEVEL hot-reload** (`core/proxy_handler.py` `config_endpoint`) — the LOG_LEVEL hot-reload path updated the `LOG_LEVEL` string in all module namespaces via the generic `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS` loop, but did not update the derived numeric sentinel `_LOG_LEVEL_N` used by `slog()` for level filtering. Since `helpers.py` imports `_LOG_LEVEL_N` at module load time (`from config import _LOG_LEVEL_N`), Python creates a local copy of the value; changing `config._LOG_LEVEL_N` does not update `helpers._LOG_LEVEL_N`. Result: changing the log level from the dashboard had no effect on actual log output. Fix: after the generic propagation loop, `config_endpoint` now explicitly recomputes `_LOG_LEVEL_N = _LOG_LEVELS.get(value, 20)` and propagates it to all loaded modules via `setattr`.

- **`NameError: name '_city_lookup' is not defined` in `ip_intel_endpoint`** (`admin/users.py`) — `ip_intel_endpoint` called `_city_lookup`, `_asn_lookup`, `_abuseipdb_lookup`, `_crowdsec_check`, and `_tor_exits` without importing them. `proxy_handler.py` has all five in its global namespace via its own import block; `admin/users.py` is a separate module with its own namespace and had none of them. Any call to the IP intel popover (identity-details in agents.html / main.html) raised `NameError` and returned HTTP 500. Fix: added `from reputation.maxmind import _city_lookup, _asn_lookup`, `from reputation.abuseipdb import _abuseipdb_lookup`, `from reputation.crowdsec import _crowdsec_check`, `from reputation.tor import _tor_exits` at module level in `admin/users.py`.
- **Dockerfile pip deps pinned to exact versions** (`Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.armv7`) — previously used range specifiers (`>=x,<y`), flagged as DL3013 / supply-chain unpinned by Aikido. Resolved currently installed versions (`aiohttp==3.13.5`, `maxminddb==2.8.2`, `psycopg[binary]==3.3.4`, `redis==5.3.1`, `pyjwt==2.12.1`) and pinned all direct deps to exact `==` constraints. Builds remain reproducible.
- **Dockerfile builder stage drops root before final stage** (`Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.armv7`) — Aikido DL3002: builder stage set `USER root` (line 6) and never reverted. Final runtime stage already runs as `USER 65532:65532`, but the linter checks per-stage. Fixed by adding `USER nonroot` at end of the Chainguard builder stage and `USER nobody` at end of the Alpine builder stage.
- **7-day graph no date labels in main/agents dashboards** (`dashboards/main.html`, `dashboards/agents.html`) — `pickBucketForRange` mapped the 7-day window to 900 s (15-min) buckets, producing 672 data points all labeled `"HH:MM"` by `fmtTime`'s sub-3600 s branch (no date component). Changed to map 7 d → 3600 s buckets (168 points, labeled `"May 3 14:00"`) and ≥ 30 d → 86400 s buckets (30 points, labeled `"May 3"`). Added `<option value="43200">30 days</option>` to the range selector in both dashboards. Added `tPickBucketForRange` + `tAutoSelectBucket` to `agents.html` (which had no equivalent auto-bucket logic) and wired it into the `t-range` change handler.

### Tests

- **`test_no_eschtml_calls`** — parametrized ×7 dashboards; asserts no call to undefined `escHtml()` (regression for 5-dashboard `escHtml` bug).
- **`test_log_level_n_propagated_on_hot_reload`** — asserts `config_endpoint` contains `_LOG_LEVEL_N` propagation and `_LOG_LEVELS.get(` recompute (regression for hot-reload numeric sentinel bug).
- **`test_ip_intel_endpoint_imports_reputation_symbols`** — asserts all 5 reputation symbols (`_city_lookup`, `_asn_lookup`, `_abuseipdb_lookup`, `_crowdsec_check`, `_tor_exits`) imported at module level in `admin/users.py` (regression for `NameError` in ip-intel endpoint).
- **`test_logs_html_log_level_button_has_rok_guard`** — asserts ≥2 `if (!r.ok)` guards in `logs.html` (regression for unconditional `r.json()` on non-JSON responses).
- **`test_logs_html_log_level_handlers_no_unconditional_json`** — verifies `r.ok` check precedes `r.json()` in each LOG_LEVEL POST handler in `logs.html`.
- **`test_logs_html_authorized_robot_shown_in_blue`** — asserts `logs.html` renders `authorized-robot` reason in `var(--blue)`.

- **`test_controls_collapse_iife_persists_to_localstorage`** — asserts `_CC_PREFIX`, `localStorage.setItem/getItem` in collapse IIFE.
- **`test_controls_collapse_card_h2_click_handler`** — asserts `querySelectorAll('.card')` + click listener in collapse IIFE.
- **`test_main_pick_bucket_7day_returns_3600`** — asserts `pickBucketForRange(10080)` maps to 3600, not 900 (regression for HH:MM-only 7-day labels).
- **`test_main_pick_bucket_30day_returns_86400`** — asserts fallthrough returns 86400 for 30-day view.
- **`test_main_30day_option_in_range_select`** — asserts `<option value="43200">` present in `main.html`.
- **`test_agents_pick_bucket_7day_returns_3600`** — asserts `tPickBucketForRange` exists in `agents.html` and returns 3600 for 7d.
- **`test_agents_pick_bucket_30day_returns_86400`** — same for 30-day.
- **`test_agents_30day_option_in_range_select`** — asserts `<option value="43200">` in `agents.html`.

- **`test_main_tooltip_callback_uses_timeline_epoch`** — asserts `main.html` tooltip uses `_lastMainTimeline`/`_lastMainBucketSecs` with `toLocaleDateString`.
- **`test_agents_tooltip_config_defined`** — asserts `agents.html` has tooltip plugin config with `_lastAgentTimeline`.
- **`test_agents_tooltip_callback_formats_date`** — asserts `agents.html` tooltip calls `toLocaleDateString/toLocaleString`.
- **`test_dockerfile_pip_deps_use_exact_pins`** — asserts no range specifiers (`>=`, `<=`, `~=`) in `Dockerfile` pip install (Aikido DL3013).
- **`test_dockerfile_armv7_pip_deps_use_exact_pins`** — same for `Dockerfile.armv7`.
- **`test_dockerfile_builder_stage_drops_root`** — asserts `USER nonroot` in `Dockerfile` builder stage (Aikido DL3002).
- **`test_dockerfile_armv7_builder_stage_drops_root`** — asserts `USER nobody` in `Dockerfile.armv7` builder stage.
- **Authorized bot tests** (×6) — `test_authorized_bot_uas_config_exists`, `test_authorized_bot_bypass_in_protect_source`, `test_authorized_bot_bypass_only_on_root`, `test_passthrough_reasons_not_counted_as_blocked`, `test_authorized_robot_tag_in_main_dashboard` — cover config existence, protect() source guard, root-only enforcement, metrics passthrough, and dashboard CSS.

### Validation
- 164 (test_pure.py) + 116 (test_critical.py) + 10 (test_async.py) tests pass; pre-existing failures in `test_v14.py` (JS challenge namespace-patch isolation) unchanged.

## [1.7.3] — 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Path-sweep detector** (`PATH_SWEEP_ENABLED=1`, default on) — new module `detection/path_sweep.py`. Fires when an identity visits ≥ `PATH_SWEEP_THRESHOLD` (default 40) distinct non-static paths within a `PATH_SWEEP_WINDOW_SECS` (default 300 s) sliding window. Unlike `behavioral.py` (skipped for cookied sessions), this detector runs for **all** identities including valid-cookied ones — specifically to catch the warm-up bypass technique (AI agent acquires valid cookie with benign traffic, then sweeps paths in fresh sessions). Static assets excluded via extension list; admin namespace excluded via `ADMIN_NAMESPACE` prefix check. Risk signal: `path-sweep`.
- **New config knobs** (path-sweep): `PATH_SWEEP_ENABLED`, `PATH_SWEEP_WINDOW_SECS`, `PATH_SWEEP_THRESHOLD`.
- **`IpState.path_sweep_times`** — `deque(maxlen=500)` sliding window of `(monotonic_ts, path)` pairs in `state.py`.
- **Geo "No geo" card** — `dashboards/geo.html` shows "No geo" summary card (private/localhost IPs with no MaxMind coordinates) via new `skipped_no_geo` field in `geo_data_endpoint`.
- **P1 — Semantic honeypot credential injection** (`HONEY_CRED_ENABLED=1`, default on) — new module `detection/honey_cred.py`. Injects a realistic-looking HTML comment before `</body>` on every proxied HTML response: `<!-- internal_api_key = <key>  debug_endpoint = /antibot-appsec-gateway/probe?k=<key>  env = staging -->`. Key is HMAC-SHA256(SESSION_KEY, identity + hourly bucket)[:32], stored in-process with 2-hour TTL. New public endpoint `GET /antibot-appsec-gateway/probe?k=<key>`: if key matches a known honey credential, fires `honey-cred` signal (+90 risk) on the issuing identity and returns bland `{"status":"ok"}` (never reveals whether key was valid). Browsers never read HTML comments; AI agents extract them from source. Risk score 90 = near-instant ban on first probe.
- **New config knobs** (honey-cred): `HONEY_CRED_ENABLED` (default `1`), `HONEY_CRED_SCORE` (default `90`).
- **P2 — Risk-gated redirect maze** (`REDIRECT_MAZE_ENABLED=0`, default off) — new module `detection/redirect_maze.py`. For identities above `REDIRECT_MAZE_THRESHOLD` risk, serves a chain of HMAC-signed redirect steps before allowing through. Token format: `{step}.{ts_ms}.{hmac16}`, 30 s TTL per step. New public endpoint `GET /antibot-appsec-gateway/maze?t=TOKEN&d=DEST`: validates token, issues next redirect (or final dest after `REDIRECT_MAZE_DEPTH` steps). If all steps completed in < `REDIRECT_MAZE_MIN_MS` (default 800 ms) → fires `redirect-maze-bot` (+55 risk). Real browsers show human latency; automated agents complete all steps in milliseconds.
- **New config knobs** (redirect maze): `REDIRECT_MAZE_ENABLED` (default `0`), `REDIRECT_MAZE_THRESHOLD` (default `20`), `REDIRECT_MAZE_DEPTH` (default `4`), `REDIRECT_MAZE_MIN_MS` (default `800`), `REDIRECT_MAZE_SCORE` (default `55`).
- **P3 — LLM no-subresource heuristic** (`LLM_HEURISTIC_ENABLED=1`, default on) — new module `detection/llm_heuristic.py`. Real browsers load CSS, JS, images, and fonts alongside every HTML page. AI agents using `WebFetch` or similar tools fetch only the HTML document — no sub-resources ever follow. Tracks HTML vs sub-resource request ratio per identity in a rolling `deque(maxlen=256)` window. When an identity has fetched ≥ `LLM_HTML_MIN_COUNT` (default 5) HTML pages with sub-resource ratio ≤ `LLM_SUBRES_RATIO_THRESHOLD` (default 0.0 = zero sub-resources) within `LLM_HEURISTIC_WINDOW_SECS` (default 120 s) → fires `llm-no-subresources` (+40 risk). Cooldown prevents double-firing within the window.
- **New config knobs** (LLM heuristic): `LLM_HEURISTIC_ENABLED` (default `1`), `LLM_HTML_MIN_COUNT` (default `5`), `LLM_SUBRES_RATIO_THRESHOLD` (default `0.0`), `LLM_HEURISTIC_WINDOW_SECS` (default `120`), `LLM_HEURISTIC_SCORE` (default `40`).
- **P4 — Browser execution probe** (`CANARY_PROBE_ENABLED=1`, default on) — extended `detection/canary.py`. Injects `<link rel="preload" href="/antibot-appsec-gateway/canary-probe/{token}" as="fetch" crossorigin>` into every HTML `<head>`. Browsers automatically fetch preload hints in the background within milliseconds; AI agents only retrieve the HTML document. New public endpoint `GET /antibot-appsec-gateway/canary-probe/{token}`: marks identity as "browser-confirmed". `check_canary_probe()`: after ≥ `CANARY_PROBE_MIN_HTML` (default 3) HTML pages, if probe was never fetched within `CANARY_PROBE_TTL_SECS` (default 30 s) → fires `canary-probe-miss` (+35 risk). Confirmed identities are immune from this signal.
- **New config knobs** (canary probe): `CANARY_PROBE_ENABLED` (default `1`), `CANARY_PROBE_TTL_SECS` (default `30`), `CANARY_PROBE_MIN_HTML` (default `3`), `CANARY_PROBE_SCORE` (default `35`).
- **New risk signals** in scoring table: `honey-cred` (+90), `redirect-maze-bot` (+55), `llm-no-subresources` (+40), `canary-probe-miss` (+35).
- **`path-sweep` + `honey-cred` in signal cost table** — `kind: state/in-process`, `typical: < 0.1 ms` (no I/O).

- **Three-tier ban durations** — `REALLY_BAN_SECS` (default 30 d = 2592000 s) added to `config.py` as a new config knob. Ban tier logic in `scoring.py` updated: definitive bot-proof signals (`canary-echo`, `honeypot-silent`, `honeypot`) now earn `REALLY_BAN_SECS`; hostile signals earn `HOSTILE_BAN_SECS` (24 h); risk-threshold bans earn `RISK_BAN_DURATION_SECS` (1 h). `REALLY_BAN_SECS` is hot-reloadable via `/secured/config`.
- **Controls dashboard — ban duration knobs** — `HOSTILE_BAN_SECS` and `REALLY_BAN_SECS` added to the Thresholds & rate limits card in `controls.html`, allowing operators to adjust ban durations live without container restart.
- **Settings dashboard — Storage card** — new "Storage" card added to `settings.html` showing disk usage bar (used/total), SQLite DB + WAL + SHM file sizes, and a "Vacuum DB" button. Card calls new admin endpoints `GET /secured/disk-stats` and `POST /secured/db-vacuum` (`VACUUM` + `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`).
- **Disk stats endpoint** (`GET /antibot-appsec-gateway/secured/disk-stats`) — returns JSON with `disk_used_bytes`, `disk_total_bytes`, `disk_free_bytes`, `db_bytes`, `wal_bytes`, `shm_bytes`. Secured (admin IP + session).
- **DB vacuum endpoint** (`POST /antibot-appsec-gateway/secured/db-vacuum`) — runs SQLite `VACUUM` + WAL checkpoint truncate; returns `{ok, db_bytes_before, db_bytes_after, wal_bytes_before, wal_bytes_after}`. Secured.

### Fixed
- **Admin-path bypass scope too broad** — Global RPS limit and Method allowlist were exempt for ALL requests to admin-namespace paths regardless of source IP. Fixed: exemption now only applies when the request comes from an admin IP. Non-admin IPs hitting admin paths are now subject to rate limiting and method filtering.
- **`geo_data_endpoint` stale `LIMIT 200000`** — removed `ORDER BY ts ASC LIMIT 200000`; query now returns all events in the window.
- **`NameError: ip not defined` in proxy() HTML injection block** — caught during validation testing. `ip` is not in scope inside the forwarding function; fixed to use `get_ip(request)` via local `_gw_ip`.
- **`JS_CHAL_REQUIRE_JA4` / `TURNSTILE_ENABLED` mutual exclusion** — 3-layer mutex: startup (config.py), DB-load (db/sqlite.py), hot-reload (proxy_handler.py config_endpoint). Prevents silent 403s on every Turnstile solve when `JS_CHAL_REQUIRE_JA4=true` is persisted in `config_kv` table while Turnstile is active (JA4 always absent behind Cloudflare CDN).
- **Silent 403 on JA4-required path emitted no log** — added `slog("chal_ja4_required_missing", level="warn", ...)` before the 403 return in `js_challenge.py`.
- **5 security findings from code review** — 1 MEDIUM (unbounded `_maze_timing` dict — added `_MAZE_TIMING_MAX=2048` + `_MAZE_STEPS_MAX=32` caps), 4 LOW (unbounded `_fired`/`_probe_confirmed` — eviction added; missing key/token length caps on public endpoints — 64/48 char limits added; dead duplicate HMAC call in `_verify_maze_token` — removed).
- **[DAST — HIGH] `NameError: name 's' is not defined` on ban recovery** — `protect()` ai-no-assets deny branch referenced `s.html_loads` / `s.static_loads` but `s` is never assigned in that code path; the correct IpState alias is `_s_early`. Any request from an IP re-entering after a ban expiry triggered an unhandled `NameError` → HTTP 500 to the client. Fixed: `proxy_handler.py` line 2840 changed to `_s_early.html_loads` / `_s_early.static_loads`. Found during DAST Step 15b ban-recovery cycle.
- **[DAST — CRITICAL] `/probe`, `/maze`, `/canary-probe/` endpoints unreachable** — All three public AI-detection endpoints were registered as aiohttp routes but absent from `_ADMIN_PUBLIC_SUBPATHS` in `config.py`. The `protect()` middleware intercepts every admin-namespace path and returns a 404 decoy (logging `reason: internal-probe`) for any path not in that list, before route dispatch. Result: P1 honey-cred, P2 redirect-maze, and P4 canary-probe detectors had zero effect in production — the probe endpoint always returned upstream HTML. Fixed: added `/probe`, `/maze`, `/canary-probe/` to `_ADMIN_PUBLIC_SUBPATHS`. Found during DAST Step 15e probe-endpoint verification.
- **[Post-release — HIGH] Turnstile shown to every first-time visitor regardless of risk score** — `_js_challenge_applicable()` gated Turnstile on `request.get("_track_key")`, which is always `None` at the JS challenge gate (gate runs at `proxy_handler.py:2282`; `_track_key` is set at line 2511). The threshold check never executed — every cookieless HTML GET triggered Turnstile immediately. Fixed: derive identity via `get_identity(request)` directly; fresh visitors with no `ip_state` entry (risk = 0) fall through to the auto-mint path. Found from user report.
- **[Post-release — MEDIUM] Soft-challenge tier never enforced on `JS_CHAL_OPEN_PATHS`** — `_js_challenge_required()` had the identical `_track_key` ordering bug: risky identities (SOFT_CHALLENGE_SCORE ≤ risk < RISK_BAN_THRESHOLD) on open paths were supposed to have their bypass revoked and be challenged. The `if track_key:` branch was always skipped (track_key = None), so the open-path bypass was always granted regardless of risk. Fixed: same pattern — derive identity via `get_identity(request)` directly.

- **`ALLOWED_HOSTS` URL parsing bug** — `_to_host_set()` in `integrations/endpoint_policy.py` accepted bare hostnames only; full URLs with scheme (e.g. `https://example.com/`) stored verbatim, causing every request to match `host-not-allowed` (bare hostname `example.com` ≠ full URL string). Fixed: `_to_host_set()` now uses `urllib.parse.urlparse` to normalise each entry — strips scheme, path, and case. Startup parser in `proxy_handler.py` updated to use the same function. Regression tests added to `test_pure.py` (`test_to_host_set_strips_scheme_and_path`).
- **Dashboard version string regression** — dashboard HTML files (`main.html`, `agents.html`, `controls.html`, `geo.html`, `logs.html`, `service.html`, `settings.html`) had `AntiBotWaf_GW_1.7.2` hardcoded in `<title>` and `<h1>` tags after `config.py` was bumped to `1.7.3`; the version is not template-rendered but literal text. Updated all 7 files to `AntiBotWaf_GW_1.7.3`. Added `test_no_stale_version_strings_in_source` (now includes `.html` in suffix set) and `test_dashboard_html_version_strings()` to `test_pure.py`; added `test_dashboard_html_version_matches_config()` to `test_control_regressions.py`. Added explicit file list to `rules.md` step 13b.

### Tests
- **37 new unit tests** in `tests/test_v173.py`: P1 honey_cred (10), P2 redirect_maze (7), P3 llm_heuristic (9), P4 canary_probe (11).
- **9 new unit tests** in `tests/test_path_sweep.py` (path-sweep detector).
- **4 new regression tests** in `tests/test_pure.py`: JA4/Turnstile mutex (startup, DB-load, hot-reload), JA4-required slog warning.
- **6 new regression tests** (Step 16 post-release bug watch): `test_probe_endpoint_in_admin_public_subpaths`, `test_maze_endpoint_in_admin_public_subpaths`, `test_canary_probe_in_admin_public_subpaths`, `test_ai_no_assets_deny_uses_s_early_not_s`, `test_js_challenge_applicable_source_uses_get_identity_not_track_key`, `test_js_challenge_required_soft_challenge_uses_get_identity_not_track_key`.
- **3 new regression tests** (post-release additions): `test_to_host_set_strips_scheme_and_path`, `test_dashboard_html_version_strings` (test_pure.py), `test_dashboard_html_version_matches_config` (test_control_regressions.py).
- **`_decay_risk` NameError in `_js_challenge_applicable`** — `challenge/js_challenge.py` called `_decay_risk(s, now())` without importing it at that scope. `_decay_risk` lives in `scoring.py` and is late-imported at other call sites in the same file but was missing from `_js_challenge_applicable`. Any request from an identity with a warmed ip_state entry (risk > 0 after prior probing) triggered `NameError → HTTP 500`. Fixed: added `from scoring import _decay_risk` inside `_js_challenge_applicable`. Regression test added (`test_js_challenge_applicable_imports_decay_risk` in test_pure.py). Found during functional + regression test run.
- **`test_html_navigation_serves_challenge_page` / `test_v9_turnstile_required_when_enabled` stale assertions** — Both tests assumed Turnstile is shown to ALL fresh visitors (old broken behavior). After the post-release fix (`_js_challenge_applicable` returning False for fresh visitors), both tests failed because fresh visitors correctly fall through to auto-mint. Updated tests to pre-seed ip_state with risk above threshold, confirming Turnstile IS shown for risky identities.
- **`tests/test_dashboard_data.py` missing from copy-to-github.sh** — added to MANIFEST.
- **Totals**: 216 tests pass (209 unit + 22 functional + 1 integration + 37 v1.7.3 + 9 path_sweep + 4 mutex + 6 post-release regression + 3 post-release additions + 1 decay-risk regression); 0 failures.

## [1.7.2] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Geo dashboard time-window navigation** — `← prev` / `next →` / `now` buttons allow stepping backward/forward through 24-hour windows. `endEpoch` state variable appended to all `geo-data` requests as `?end=<epoch>`. `refreshGeoControls()` disables `next →` at live mode and updates the window label.
- **Geo drill scrubber-aware queries** — `openDrill()` now passes `?end=<bucketEnd>&range=<bucketMin>` when a scrubber bucket is active, scoping the drill-down to that time window instead of always querying live.
- **Geo map denied-country visual** — circles for IPs whose country is in the denylist are rendered with a red border (`weight:3`, `dashArray:'4,3'`) and a `⛔ DENIED ·` prefix in the popup.
- **Admin IP lock icon in geo drill panel** — `_drillAdminLock()` helper added to `geo.html`; IP rows now show 🔒 with full tooltip when `is_admin_ip` is true.
- **`is_admin_ip` in geo drill response** — `geo_drill_endpoint` now includes `is_admin_ip` for each IP in the response map.
- **Country table allow buttons** — `renderCountries()` now renders both deny and allow buttons; allow POST uses `"list":"allow"` without forcing `COUNTRY_BLOCK_ENABLED:true`.

### Fixed
- **`main.html` cost chart click** — `onClick` handler reverted to direct `openMainBucketDetail(tl[idx], ...)` call, eliminating the silent `find()` failure that caused the modal to open empty on bucket-boundary mismatches.
- **Admin IP lock icon tooltip** — `_adminLock` / `_ADMIN_IP_TIP` moved to global scope in `main.html`; previously the helper was defined inside `openMainBucketDetail` only. All five 🔒 occurrences across both main and agents panels now show the full description on hover.
- **`geo_data_endpoint` ordering** — events query now includes `ORDER BY ts ASC`; previously events could be returned in insertion order, causing garbled map animation when backfilling.
- **`_GEO_CACHE` LRU eviction** — eviction previously sorted by key tuple value (`sorted(keys())`), not by expiry time. Fixed to `sorted(keys(), key=lambda k: _GEO_CACHE[k][0])` so oldest entries are evicted first.
- **Geo scrubber label** — "— · live" changed to "— · live (aggregate)" to disambiguate from a time-scoped bucket.
- **Country table colspan** — no-data rows used `colspan="6"` despite the table having 7 columns. Fixed to `colspan="7"`.
- **Geo dashboard dead code** — removed unused `url()` arrow function and `setInterval(loadLogLevel, 30000)` (log-level polling not applicable in geo page).
- **Missed signal note** — added inline note in scrubber div explaining that missed counts are unavailable in scrubber mode (sourced from live `ip_state`, not DB events).
- **All dashboard version badges** — `AntiBotWaf_GW_1.7.1` → `AntiBotWaf_GW_1.7.2` in `main.html`, `controls.html`, `agents.html`, `logs.html`, `settings.html`, `service.html`, `geo.html`.
- **JS SyntaxErrors in `main.html` and `agents.html`** — smart/typographic quotes (U+2018/U+2019) in `_adminLock` fallback literal and unescaped apostrophe in `_ADMIN_IP_TIP` string caused `Uncaught SyntaxError` that silently killed all dashboard JS (`tick()` never ran → zero stats). Fixed `_ADMIN_IP_TIP` to use double-quoted string; `_adminLock` fallback to ASCII single quotes.
- **Blockrate chart always empty in `main.html`** — `d.timeline.buckets` does not exist; `d.timeline` is the array directly. Fixed to `Array.isArray(d.timeline) ? d.timeline : []` with `b.t||b.ts` for timestamp field.
- **CI `docker-no-latest-tag` linter failure** — added `exceptions.yaml` to suppress the conftest rule for Chainguard images; both `FROM` lines are already pinned by `@sha256` digest so the `:latest` tag is a registry alias, not a floating reference.
- **`copy-to-github.sh` manifest** — added five missing detection modules (`automation.py`, `cookie_lifecycle.py`, `referer_chain.py`, `impossible_travel.py`, `fp_enrichment.py`), `dashboards/assets/chart.umd.min.js` (Chart.js 4.4.0 local bundle), and `exceptions.yaml` so `copy-to-github.sh` delivers all CI-required files to the GitHub repo.
- **Chart.js CDN → local bundle** — moved from `cdn.jsdelivr.net` to `/antibot-appsec-gateway/assets/chart.umd.min.js` to avoid CDN blocking in air-gapped deployments.
- **`_refresh_integration_state` missing `globals()` arg** — `proxy_handler.py` had two call sites (`secrets_endpoint` at line 1566, `config_endpoint` at line 1622) that called `_refresh_integration_state()` without the required `globals()` argument. All 3 arch images were rebuilt with `--no-cache`; the stale baked-in bytecode had been masking the fix from source.
- **`_refresh_integration_state` unconditionally overwrote `TURNSTILE_ENABLED`** — setting any secret (even unrelated ones like ABUSEIPDB_KEY) would re-derive `TURNSTILE_ENABLED=True` when credentials were present, ignoring the operator's explicit on/off choice. Fixed: auto-enable fires only on first-time credential availability (`prev_configured=False → now=True`); subsequent explicit enable/disable choices via `/config` or Controls dashboard are preserved.
- **Upstream CSP blocks Turnstile widgets** — `_csp_inject_cf_turnstile()` added to `proxy_handler.py`; applied to upstream HTML responses at the proxy layer. Augments existing `script-src` and `frame-src` directives (or `default-src` fallback) to add `https://challenges.cloudflare.com`, preventing CSP violations when the upstream site embeds Turnstile widgets but its policy omits that origin.

### Tests
- **201 unit tests + 22 functional + 23 integration + 76 regression**: all pass (individually due to pre-existing OOM when run together). 0 new failures.
- **7 new regression tests** in `test_pure.py`: `test_no_smart_quotes_in_main_html`, `test_no_smart_quotes_in_agents_html`, `test_main_html_js_syntax` (node --check), `test_agents_html_js_syntax`, `test_no_broken_string_assignments_in_main_html`, `test_no_broken_string_assignments_in_agents_html`, `test_admin_ip_tip_uses_double_quotes` — prevent regression of the JS SyntaxError bug class.
- **5 new pure unit tests** in `test_pure.py`: `test_csp_inject_adds_to_script_src`, `test_csp_inject_adds_to_frame_src`, `test_csp_inject_noop_when_already_present`, `test_csp_inject_augments_default_src_when_no_script_src`, `test_csp_inject_preserves_other_directives` — cover `_csp_inject_cf_turnstile` behaviour.
- **1 new integration test** `test_host_allowlist_blocks_mismatch_api_path` — verifies route-aware decoy returns 404 (not 200) for API paths with mismatched Host header.
- **3 test fixes** for route-aware decoy behaviour (API paths → 404, not 200): `test_host_allowlist_blocks_mismatch` (path `/api/x` → `/some-page`), `test_v8_block_does_not_reveal_gateway` and `test_host_mismatch_silent_decoys_even_without_cookie` (`== 200` → `in (200, 404)`). Security invariant unchanged — no 401/gateway fingerprint leaks.

### Validation
- Bandit: 0 High · 0 Critical · 12 Low (all B110 try/except/pass, pre-existing, accepted FP).
- Semgrep: 0 findings.
- Trivy: 0 Critical / 0 High / 0 Medium CVEs.
- §13b version sweep: all non-comment occurrences updated; remaining `1.7.1` hits are code-history annotations (`# 1.7.1 — feature name`) intentionally preserved.

## [1.7.1] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Browser automation probe** (`AUTOMATION_PROBE_ENABLED=1`, default on) — self-hosted JS snippet injected into HTML responses that checks `navigator.webdriver`, `navigator.plugins.length === 0`, `screen.colorDepth < 24`, and missing `window.chrome` object. POSTs result to new public endpoint `/antibot-appsec-gateway/automation-report`. Fires `webdriver-detected` (+30 risk) when ≥ 2 indicators set. No external JS bundle; HMAC token bound to `track_key` so reports cannot be forged. Mirrors BotD pattern in `detection/canary.py`.
- **Coordinated ASN clustering** (`COORDINATED_ATTACK_ENABLED=1`, default on) — detects when N≥5 (`COORDINATED_ATTACK_THRESHOLD`) distinct identities from the same ASN hit the same path prefix within the same 60-second window. Fires `coordinated-probe` (+25 risk) on each member of the cluster. Cluster state stored in `state._asn_path_clusters`; pruned automatically when >10000 entries. Escalate-only signal.
- **User journey sequences / direct-API-probe** (`JOURNEY_CHECK_ENABLED=1`, default on) — second-order signal that fires when an identity has made ≥5 requests with `html_loads=0` and `static_loads=0` while hitting an API-style path prefix (`/api/`, `/v1/`, `/v2/`, `/graphql`, `/rest/`, `/rpc/`). Fires `direct-api-probe` (+15 risk). Gated by `SECOND_ORDER_THRESHOLD` so it only accumulates risk on already-suspicious identities. Added `path_sequence: deque(maxlen=5)` field to `IpState` for future journey analysis.
- **New risk signals**: `webdriver-detected` (+30), `coordinated-probe` (+25), `direct-api-probe` (+15).
- **New config knobs** (all hot-reloadable): `AUTOMATION_PROBE_ENABLED`, `COORDINATED_ATTACK_ENABLED`, `COORDINATED_ATTACK_THRESHOLD`, `JOURNEY_CHECK_ENABLED`.
- **New public endpoint**: `POST /antibot-appsec-gateway/automation-report` — receives browser automation probe reports. Added to `_ADMIN_PUBLIC_SUBPATHS` so it bypasses admin-IP gating.
- **New module**: `detection/automation.py` — `_inject_automation_probe()`, `automation_report_endpoint()`, `_automation_token_for()`.

### Fixed
- **`dashboards/agents.html`** — bucket detail popover had no `max-height` / `overflow-y`. With `position:fixed` centering, content taller than the viewport was clipped at the top — hiding the IP list. Fixed: `maxHeight:'85vh'; overflowY:'auto'` applied on open; cleared on close.
- **`dashboards/agents.html`** — `openBucketDetail` had no try/catch; any fetch error silently killed the popover. Fixed: added try/catch that displays a styled error message in the popover body.
- **`dashboards/main.html`** — `openMainBucketDetail` catch block swallowed fetch errors and showed empty lists with no diagnostic. Fixed: `_fetchErr` stored and prepended as a red error div in the modal body.

### Tests
- **187 tests passing**: 181 unit + 22 functional + 16 integration + 98 regression. 0 failures (individually).
- +6 integration tests (`test_integration.py`): `test_agents_bucket_decoy_without_auth`, `test_agents_bucket_shape_with_auth`, `test_agents_bucket_bad_t_param_returns_400`, `test_agents_bucket_invalid_bucket_secs_falls_back_to_60`, `test_agents_bucket_list_cap_500`, `test_agents_bucket_kind_filter`. Guards `agents-bucket` endpoint auth, response shape (including `ip` field presence), input validation, param sanitisation, and 500-entry list cap.

### Validation
- Bandit: 0 High · 0 Critical · 0 Medium (including new `detection/automation.py`).
- Semgrep: 0 findings on new module (151 rules, 0 findings).
- Trivy (arm64): 0 Critical / 0 High / 0 Medium CVEs.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Modular refactor (Phase 5–8)** — 13,696-line `proxy.py` monolith split into 30+ modules:
  `config`, `state`, `helpers`, `identity`, `rate_limit`, `scoring`, `admin/*`, `challenge/*`,
  `core/*`, `dashboards/*`, `db/*`, `detection/*`, `integrations/*`, `reputation/*`.
  Public API and all behaviour unchanged; no new features.

### Fixed
- `Dockerfile` — v1.7.0 module directories were not copied; caused `ModuleNotFoundError` at container startup. Added `COPY` for all 15 module packages and top-level modules.
- `dashboards/service_metrics.py` — `_postgres_available` NameError at svc-metrics sample time (underscore name excluded by `import *`). Added explicit import.
- `dashboards/service_metrics.py` — NaN/Inf injection in `end=` query parameter: raw value flowed into `float()` without guard. Added string rejection for all NaN/Inf spellings before cast.
- `core/proxy_handler.py` — `_global_rps_window`, `_pow_seen`, `_canary_tokens` NameErrors. Added explicit state imports.
- `proxy.py` — Namespace-aware `tarpit_endpoint` wrapper reads `LABYRINTH_ENABLED` from proxy globals; fixes `test_tarpit_endpoint_disabled_returns_404` in exec_module test context.
- `proxy.py` — Patches `core.proxy_handler.get_ip` at module level so `TRUSTED_PROXIES_NETS` test patches propagate; fixes `test_xff_spoof_blocked_when_peer_untrusted`.
- `scoring.py` — `_HOSTILE_REASONS` NameError (underscore excluded by `import *`). Added explicit import from config.
- `proxy.py` `db_load_config()` — test-isolation regression: removed sys.modules propagation loop from `db/sqlite.py`; wrapper now cascades via `_ProxyModule.__setattr__` only when the calling module is the registered `sys.modules["proxy"]` object, preventing cross-contamination in exec_module test contexts.
- `db/sqlite.py` `db_load_config()` — `DB_PATH` now resolved as `g.get("DB_PATH") or os.environ.get("DB_PATH") or DB_PATH` so callers that override `DB_PATH` via env (e.g. isolation tests) connect to the correct database.
- `db/sqlite.py` `db_load_config()` — credential keys (`ABUSEIPDB_KEY` etc.) from the passed globals dict are now synced into `core.proxy_handler` before validators run, so credential-gated validators (e.g. `ABUSEIPDB_ENABLED`'s `lambda v: (not v) or bool(globals().get("ABUSEIPDB_KEY"))`) see the correct state when called in isolation without a prior `db_load_secrets`.

### Tests
- **309 tests passing**: 179 unit (116 critical + 53 pure + 10 async) + 22 functional + 10 integration + 98 regression. 0 failures.
- +3 functional tests: `test_db_load_config_accepts_abuseipdb_enabled_with_key`, `test_config_hot_reload_roundtrip`, `test_db_load_config_rejects_invalid_knob` (all pass with above fixes).
- +4 regression tests (new coverage added to test_v14.py / test_v142.py).
- Two previously failing functional tests fixed: `test_xff_spoof_blocked_when_peer_untrusted`, `test_tarpit_endpoint_disabled_returns_404`.

### Validation
- Bandit: 0 High · 0 Critical · 0 Medium.
- Semgrep: 0 findings (1 NaN-injection fixed before release).
- Trivy (amd64): 0 Critical / 0 High / 0 Medium CVEs.
- See `validation/1.7.0.md` for full record.

## [1.6.10] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **10 new detection signals** — 5 HIGH + 5 MEDIUM impact:
  - `header-order-fp` (+8) — HTTP library fingerprint via ordered header-name hash (requests/curl/Go/httpx signatures).
  - `ai-ua-ip-mismatch` (+30) — AI-crawler UA but source IP not in vendor's published CIDR range (OpenAI gptbot-ranges.txt, refreshed 24h).
  - `locale-geo-mismatch` (+10) — primary Accept-Language tag implausible for GeoIP country; escalate-gated.
  - `robots-violation` (+5) — declared AI-crawler UA ignores gateway `/robots.txt` (`Disallow: /`).
  - `h2-fp` (+3, default OFF) — HTTP/1.1 + modern-browser UA behind TLS proxy.
  - `header-order-fp`, `ai-ua-ip-mismatch`, `locale-geo-mismatch`, `robots-violation`, `h2-fp`, `json-canary` all appear in Controls dashboard with toggles.
- **PoW difficulty scaling by risk_score** — `make_pow_challenge()` now accepts `risk_score`; maps 0–19→d=5, 20–50→d=7, >50→d=9. Anubis-mode still takes precedence.
- **PoW minimum solve time** (`POW_MIN_SOLVE_MS=200`) — `verify_pow()` rejects solutions arriving < (MIN−1000) ms after token issuance; blocks pre-computed replay attacks.
- **JSON API canary poisoning** (`JSON_CANARY_ENABLED=1`) — injects `"_ref": "agw-c-…"` token into JSON object responses; LLM agents replaying cached API responses echo the token, triggering `canary-echo` ban.
- **JA4 fail-closed** (`JA4_FAIL_CLOSED=0` default) — when `JA4_TRUSTED_NETS` configured, hard-deny non-static requests missing the JA4 header.
- **Session churn threshold scaling** — hosting ASNs use `NEW_SESSIONS_PER_HOSTING=10` (vs 30 for consumer ISPs); ASN lookup performed on new-session path only.
- **`/robots.txt` endpoint** — gateway serves a static robots.txt disallowing all known AI crawlers (`GPTBot`, `ChatGPT-User`, `PerplexityBot`, `ClaudeBot`, `anthropic-ai`, `FacebookBot`, `meta-externalagent`).
- **AI crawler IP-range verification** — startup task fetches `openai.com/gptbot-ranges.txt`; cached 24h; no-op when ranges unavailable (fail-open).
- **Controls tooltip — rich signal panel** — clicking any signal name in Defenses & Scoring now shows a structured panel: version/date badge, tier badge, description, impact (+N pts with colour), cost (kind badge + ms), and configuration block (toggle knob + env var instruction or "always-on" notice). `Esc` or click-away to dismiss.
- **`kind-modifier` CSS badge** — modifier signals now render a grey badge in the cost column instead of `—`.

### Fixed
- **`pow_endpoint` difficulty** — previously hardcoded `ANUBIS_DIFFICULTY_BOOST`; now passes caller's risk_score to `make_pow_challenge` and reads `eff_diff` from the signed payload.

### Tests
- 153 unit tests passing (102 critical + 51 pure). New knobs added to `test_165_every_knob_persists_round_trip`.

### Bandit
- 0 High · 0 Critical · 0 Medium (unchanged).

## [1.6.9] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **AI Labyrinth** — hidden `rel="nofollow"` link block injected before `</body>` on every
  proxied HTML response. Any client that follows one enters a slow-drip maze of convincing
  fake documentation pages (deterministic per-nonce content, 16 topics × 20 sentences).
  Each hit fires `tarpit-walk` (weight 100 → instant ban) and streams the HTML in 256-byte
  chunks with a configurable inter-chunk delay (`LABYRINTH_SLOW_MS`, default 600 ms) to
  exhaust crawler resources. Maze depth configurable via `LABYRINTH_MAX_DEPTH` (default 5
  levels) and `LABYRINTH_LINKS_PER_PAGE` (default 3 hidden links per page). HMAC-signed
  tokens (using `POW_HMAC_KEY`) prevent depth forgery. Inspired by Cloudflare AI Labyrinth.
- New detector `tarpit-walk` (risk weight 100, `hard` tier) added to `RISK_WEIGHTS` and
  `REASON_INFO` in the main dashboard.
- `tarpit_endpoint` route: `GET /antibot-appsec-gateway/tarpit/{token}` — public but
  HMAC-gated; invalid tokens 404 silently.
- 4 new hot-reloadable knobs: `LABYRINTH_ENABLED`, `LABYRINTH_SLOW_MS`,
  `LABYRINTH_MAX_DEPTH`, `LABYRINTH_LINKS_PER_PAGE`.

### Fixed
- Renamed `TARPIT_*` labyrinth variables to `LABYRINTH_*` to eliminate name conflict with
  the pre-existing `TARPIT_ENABLED` / `TARPIT_DELAY_MS` soft-band response-delay feature
  introduced in 1.6.5.
- Replaced `_to_bool()` call in module-level config block with inline
  `os.environ.get(...) in ("1","true","yes")` — `_to_bool` is defined later in the file
  and caused `NameError` at test-collection time.
- Added `/tarpit/` to `_ADMIN_PUBLIC_SUBPATHS` — tarpit URLs were unreachable by non-admin
  IPs (returned silent 404-decoy instead of slow-drip response) because all paths under
  `/antibot-appsec-gateway/` are admin-IP gated by default. The HMAC token provides
  sufficient authenticity verification; IP restriction defeats the bot-trap purpose.
- Fixed `NameError` in `tarpit_endpoint`: replaced non-existent helper calls
  `_get_track_key()` / `_get_session_id()` / `_get_fp()` with a single `get_identity()`
  call — the tarpit handler bypasses the protect() middleware (public subpath) so identity
  must be derived inside the handler.

### Tests
- Added `LABYRINTH_ENABLED`, `LABYRINTH_SLOW_MS`, `LABYRINTH_MAX_DEPTH`,
  `LABYRINTH_LINKS_PER_PAGE` to `test_165_every_knob_persists_round_trip` fixture to
  satisfy the "every knob must have a test value" coverage assertion.
- 10 new unit tests: `test_168_labyrinth_knobs_in_hot_reload`,
  `test_168_labyrinth_tarpit_walk_in_risk_weights`, `test_168_labyrinth_tarpit_walk_high_weight`,
  `test_168_tarpit_token_roundtrip`, `test_168_tarpit_verify_rejects_tampered`,
  `test_168_tarpit_inject_html_adds_hidden_div`, `test_168_tarpit_inject_html_no_body_tag_passthrough`,
  `test_168_tarpit_page_html_has_fake_content`, `test_168_tarpit_public_subpath_registered`,
  `test_168_admin_path_is_public_tarpit`.
- 4 new functional tests: `test_labyrinth_links_injected_in_html_response`,
  `test_tarpit_endpoint_accessible_without_admin_auth`, `test_tarpit_endpoint_rejects_invalid_token`,
  `test_tarpit_endpoint_disabled_returns_404`.
- Full suite: **286/286 passing** (272 pre-existing + 14 new AI Labyrinth tests).

## [1.6.8] — TimescaleDB stats + dashboard UX improvements

### Added
- **TimescaleDB / Postgres health metrics** — new `_pg_timescale_stats()` function samples
  hypertable sizes, chunk counts, compression ratio, continuous-aggregate freshness, and
  Postgres cache-hit ratio every `SVC_METRICS_INTERVAL` seconds. Stats persisted alongside
  existing service-metrics samples. Surfaces on the Service dashboard under a dedicated
  "PostgreSQL / TimescaleDB" section with a click-to-zoom chart modal.
- **PG cache-hit ratio** averaged within each service-metrics bucket and exposed in
  `/__service-data`.
- **TimescaleDB stats availability flag** (`timescale_available`) in `/__service-data`
  payload — front-end conditionally renders the TimescaleDB card only when the extension is
  present.
- **Per-detector hits — clickable drill-down** — each detector name in the main dashboard's
  "Per-detector hits" card is now a clickable `.det-drill` span that calls
  `openReasonDrill()`, opening the existing rich modal with reason description, tier, weight,
  and all offending identities. Previously these were plain text labels.
- **Service dashboard threshold indicators** — CPU, memory, disk, and cgroup-memory progress
  bars are now wrapped in `.bar-wrap` with tick marks at 75 % (yellow) and 90 % (red). The
  bar fill colour transitions through green → yellow → red as usage crosses those thresholds.
  Threshold ticks and a legend are rendered via CSS (`.thr-tick.warn`, `.thr-tick.crit`,
  `.thr-legend`). Threshold lines also appear as horizontal dashed datasets in the
  click-to-zoom chart modals.
- **Disk card — available space** — the disk sub-text now shows `used / avail / total` (was
  `used / total`).

### Fixed
- Stale variable name `_geoip_asn_reader` → `_asn_reader` in service-metrics endpoint
  (line ~5515). The old name caused `"mmdb missing"` to appear in the MaxMind ASN row of
  the service dashboard even when the MMDB was loaded correctly.

---

## [1.6.7] — Gateway Registry + multi-user auth + per-session ledger + mesh-sync

### Added
- **Gateway Registry** — Settings tab with list / distribution matrix / audit log; 11 REST
  endpoints under `/antibot-appsec-gateway/secured/admin/gw-registry/...`. `gw_id`
  auto-derives from the domain; operator may override. Typed-confirm delete; copy-once
  private-key reveal modal; production-environment edit warning.
- **Multi-user auth + login flow** — bearer-key auth (`?key=` / `X-Admin-Key`) removed;
  only entry to `/secured/...` is signing in via `/antibot-appsec-gateway/login` with the
  `agw_session` cookie. `INTERNAL_KEY` is the bootstrap admin password. First-time-setup
  hint on login page disappears after first user is created. 5/min/IP login rate-limit;
  scrypt-hashed passwords (N=2¹⁴, random salt); `STRICT_ORIGIN` CSRF guard on
  `POST /login`.
- **Per-session ledger** — every login mints a fresh `sid` embedded in the cookie HMAC
  payload (`username|sid|expiry|HMAC`). `user_sessions` table records source IP + UA +
  created/last-seen/expires/status. Click any username → modal lists sessions with per-row
  Revoke. Logout revokes the current `sid` server-side.
- **Mesh-sync of integration secrets** — toggle next to each integration value in Controls
  (off by default). When on + `REDIS_URL` set, publishes value to
  `appsecgw:mesh:offers:<gw_id>` every 30 s (TTL 60 s); peers land novel offers in
  `gw_sync_pending` with `status=pending` only when the local value is empty. Nothing
  reaches a live integration without operator confirmation. `ADMIN_KEY` / `SESSION_KEY` /
  `INTERNAL_KEY` excluded from allowlist.
- **UX polish** — green ● LIVE pill normalised across every dashboard; portal footer
  (Antibot AppSec Gateway · © 2026 pt4.tech, S.A. · Confidential); Sign-out link inline
  next to Settings in every topnav with confirm prompt; Online column in Users table (60 s
  in-memory TTL).
- Additive column upgrades for `admin_ips` and other tables driven by a central registry
  (`_SCHEMA_UPGRADES`) — safe to run on existing volumes.
- Liveness probe (`/antibot-appsec-gateway/live`) is now loopback-only to prevent external
  enumeration; container `HEALTHCHECK` migrated accordingly.

### Security
- **Black-box pentest (8 attacks, 0 bypasses)**: forged cookie, legacy 3-part token, cookie
  tampering, replay-after-revoke, login brute-force, CSRF-on-login, retired bearer-key ×2,
  mesh-sync without auth — all blocked.

### Tests
- 272 / 272 passing (153 unit + 15 functional + 10 integration + 94 regression).
- New tests: `test_167_gw_id_validator`, `test_167_gw_keypair_roundtrip`,
  `test_167_gw_row_to_dict_strips_private_key`, `test_167_registry_endpoints_registered`,
  `test_167_local_gw_id_resolves`, `test_167_gw_id_from_domain`,
  `test_167_mesh_sync_eligible_keys_allowlist`, `test_167_mesh_sync_endpoints_registered`,
  `test_167_session_revoke_invalidates_cookie`, `test_167_session_token_format_includes_sid`,
  `test_internal_authed_rejects_bearer_key_post_1_6_7`,
  `test_internal_authed_accepts_valid_session_cookie`,
  `test_internal_authed_rejects_tampered_cookie`.
- **Bandit**: 0 High / 0 Critical · 13 Mediums (all confirmed FP: B104 / B608 / B310).
- **Trivy**: 0 CVEs.

---

## [1.6.6] — Settings dashboard + endpoint-namespace migration + admin-IP dual-write

### Added
- **Settings dashboard** (`/antibot-appsec-gateway/secured/settings`) — export every
  hot-reload knob + admin-IP allowlist (optionally integration secrets) as a zipped XML
  archive; import with dry-run / overwrite-secrets toggles, validating each knob through the
  same parser/validator pair as `POST /__config`. ZIP hardened: 1 MiB upload cap + 4 MiB
  inflated cap + strict `appsecgw-config.xml` entry name (no path traversal).
- **Endpoint namespace migration** — every internal endpoint moved under
  `/antibot-appsec-gateway`. Public sub-paths one level up; admin endpoints under
  `/antibot-appsec-gateway/secured/...`. Legacy `/__*` aliases removed (silent-decoy 404).
  Dockerfile + compose `HEALTHCHECK` migrated.
- **Dual-write of config changes** — `_pg_mirror_kv` lands every `set_config` /
  `del_config` / `set_secret` / `del_secret` / `admin_ip_*` SQLite write into Postgres
  alongside. Standby Postgres schema initialised at boot (idempotent `ALTER` for upgrade
  path) regardless of active backend.
- Identity strip on Settings page exposes gateway domain, upstream, version, DB backend,
  and uptime via `/__health-score` (extended with new fields).

### Tests
- 3 new tests: `test_166_admin_namespace_constants`, `test_166_admin_path_classifier`,
  `test_166_settings_endpoints_registered`.
- **Bandit**: 0 H / 0 C · 12 Mediums (B104 / B608 / B310 / B314 — `ET.fromstring` on import
  endpoint mitigated by 1 MiB cap + admin auth gate).
- **Trivy**: 0 CVEs.

---

## [1.6.5] — Observability + escalation tier + pattern expansion + Postgres backend

### Added
- **Per-detector latency telemetry** — `_detector_record(reason, ms)` rolling 200-sample
  deque per reason. `/__detector-stats` returns p50/p99 + per-method aggregation + chal-
  cookie mint rate.
- **Lists snapshot endpoint** (`/__lists-snapshot`) — sizes, last-updated timestamps, and
  enabled flags for every allow/deny/pattern list.
- **Detection-method bucketing** — `_REASON_METHOD` maps every block reason into 10 buckets;
  dashboard shows stacked-bar, top-method ranking, rolling block-rate trend.
- **Escalation gate** — expensive / external detectors (AbuseIPDB / CrowdSec / MaxMind ASN /
  body-pattern / DLP) skipped for `risk_score < ESCALATION_THRESHOLD`. New knob
  `ESCALATION_THRESHOLD` (hot-reloadable). Escalate icon rendered in Controls table.
- **Suspicious-body / path pattern expansion** — body groups 6–12 patterns each; 70+
  suspicious-path patterns (Spring4Shell, Log4Shell, IMDS, double-encoded traversal, reverse
  shells, NoSQL/LDAP injection, CRLF, all major template engines).
- **DB_BACKEND toggle** — `sqlite` (default) or `postgres` (Timescale-backed). Switching
  requires restart; falls back to SQLite with startup warning when `psycopg` absent.
- **Postgres / TimescaleDB event store** — `POSTGRES_DSN` env var; hypertable on `ts`
  column (TIMESTAMPTZ); continuous aggregates; dual-write of every `config_kv` /
  `admin_ip` / secret change for zero-loss standby migration.
- **FingerprintJS BotD client-side detector** (`BOTD_ENABLED`, hot-reloadable) — fires
  `botd-detected` (weight 60) on positive report.
- **Slowloris guard** — `BODY_TIMEOUT` terminates connections that take longer than N
  seconds to deliver request body; fires `body-timeout`.
- **Logs dashboard** — two tabs (connection logs from SQLite / gateway logs from in-memory
  ring), level filter, search, pause/resume, segmented `LOG_LEVEL` push toggle.
- **CSV export** (`/__logs-export`, up to 50 000 events).
- **TARPIT mitigation** (`TARPIT_ENABLED`, `TARPIT_DELAY_MS`) — identities in the
  soft-challenge band receive artificial response delay to degrade scripted throughput
  without revealing the block.
- **UI prefs persistence** — GeoMap + Logs filter state saved in `sessionStorage`.
- **Hot-reload knob persistence** in `config_kv` SQLite table; env wins over DB for GitOps
  determinism. 14 new promoted knobs.

### Tests
- 130 unit passing (8 new for 1.6.5).
- **Bandit**: 0 High / 0 Critical.
- **Trivy**: 0 CVEs.

---

## [1.6.4] — Pluggable event store + GW health pill + Logs dashboard (initial)

### Added
- **GW status pill** — fixed top-right pill on every dashboard showing a 0–100 health score
  (red → yellow → green at 50 / 80 thresholds). Click → modal with per-pillar breakdown:
  `disk` / `memory` / `db` / `integrations` / `bans` / `block_rate`. Refreshes every 15 s.
  New endpoint `/__health-score`.
- **Logs dashboard** (first iteration) — two tabs (connection logs / gateway logs), level
  filter, search, pause/resume, segmented `LOG_LEVEL` push toggle.
- **DB_BACKEND knob** with "RESTART REQUIRED" warning in Controls dashboard.

### Tests
- 5 new tests: `test_164_db_backend_default_sqlite`,
  `test_164_db_backend_falls_back_when_psycopg_missing`,
  `test_164_postgres_dsn_knob_registered`, `test_164_health_score_endpoint_registered`,
  `test_164_health_score_payload_shape`.

---

## [1.6.3] — GeoMap triage upgrade + risk-weight calibration

### Added
- **GeoMap — country leaderboard** — side panel listing top 12 countries by
  clean/missed/blocked. One-click Deny pushes ISO code into `COUNTRY_DENYLIST`.
- **Click-circle drill modal** (`/__geo-drill`) — top 25 IPs at the clicked 0.5° cell,
  top 10 block reasons, top 10 paths.
- **Tor / DC overlay toggles** — yellow triangles for Tor exits, purple squares for
  datacenter/VPN ASNs. Two new metric cards.
- **Animated time scrubber** — 24-bucket replay control; Play / Pause / "jump to live".
  `/__geo-data` extended with `countries`, `events`, `geo_state`, `tor_hits`, `dc_hits`.
- **Risk-weight calibration** (post-Tier-C review) — 15 weights adjusted; body-* family
  promoted to instant-ban (40→50); `crowdsec` 60→70; `suspicious-path` 40→50;
  `abuseipdb-high` 50 (unchanged); `abuseipdb-med` 15→20; `tor-exit` 50→40;
  `datacenter-vpn` 30→25.

### Tests
- 3 new tests: `test_163_geo_drill_endpoint_registered`, `test_163_geo_data_payload_shape`,
  `test_163_geo_drill_payload_shape`.

---

## [1.6.2] — Tier C: response-side DLP + webhook event filter

### Added
- **Outbound DLP scanning** (`DLP_ENABLED=1`) — response-body scanner running after upstream
  reply. 7 named groups: `cc` (Luhn-validated) · `aws` · `jwt` · `private-key` · `api-key`
  · `pii-email` · `pii-ssn`. Per-group kill-switches (`DLP_GROUP_*_ENABLED`). Bounded by
  `DLP_MAX_BYTES` (default 256 KiB). Optional inline redaction (`DLP_REDACT=1` →
  `[REDACTED-<group>]`). DLP hits fire a `dlp_leak` webhook event with group breakdown.
  Zero risk added to requester (upstream leakage ≠ client malice).
- **Webhook event filter** (`WEBHOOK_EVENT_FILTER`) — CSV / fnmatch-glob subscription list.
  Empty = legacy behaviour (every event). Filter applied before Redis dedup.
- 11 new hot-reloadable knobs (88 total). 7 new `RISK_WEIGHTS` entries (weight 0).

### Tests
- 15 new tests for Tier C (DLP and webhook filter coverage).

---

## [1.6.1] — Tier B: custom rules + per-endpoint rate-limit + body groups + JWT

### Added
- **Custom rules engine** (`CUSTOM_RULES` JSON) — Cloudflare-Custom-Rules parity.
  `[{"if":{...},"then":"allow|block|challenge|tag"}]`. First-match-wins at L0.4. `allow`
  short-circuits chain; `block` fires `custom-rule-block` (weight 50 → ban).
- **Per-endpoint rate limit** — `ENDPOINT_POLICIES` extended with `{rps, burst}` per glob.
  Token-bucket per (path, identity); overage fires `rate-limit-endpoint` (zero risk, pure
  throttle).
- **Managed body-pattern groups** — legacy `BODY_PATTERN_MATCH` split into 6 named groups
  (`sqli` / `xss` / `lfi` / `rce` / `ssrf` / `cmd`). Each has its own kill-switch
  (`BODY_GROUP_*_ENABLED`) and fires `body-<group>` (weights 40–50; rce + cmd at ban
  threshold). Most-severe-first match order; `suspicious-body` is the catch-all.
- **JWT / Bearer signature validation** — `JWT_VALIDATE_PATHS` glob list + `JWT_HMAC_SECRET`
  (HS256, stdlib, no PyJWT). Optional `JWT_REQUIRED_ISSUER` / `JWT_REQUIRED_AUDIENCE` /
  `JWT_LEEWAY_SECS`. Mismatch fires `auth-jwt-invalid` (weight 25).
- 10 new hot-reloadable knobs (77 total). 9 new `RISK_WEIGHTS` entries.

### Tests
- 12 new tests for Tier B.

---

## [1.6.0] — Tier A: country block + AI-crawler groups + Tor/DC + endpoint policies

### Added
- **Country-level geo block** (`COUNTRY_BLOCK_ENABLED`, `COUNTRY_DENYLIST` /
  `COUNTRY_ALLOWLIST`) — uses GeoLite2-City in-process (~0.1 ms), fires `country-blocked`
  (weight 50 → instant ban). Allowlist takes precedence.
- **AI-crawler granular toggles** — legacy `UA_BLOCKLIST` AI section split into 6 named
  groups (`AI_UA_OPENAI_ENABLED` / `_ANTHROPIC_` / `_GOOGLE_` / `_PERPLEXITY_` / `_META_`
  / `_OTHER_`). Per-vendor reason (`ua-ai-openai`, …).
- **Tor exit-node feed** (`TOR_BLOCK_ENABLED`) — weekly auto-fetch of
  `check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist`. O(1) set membership. `tor-exit` weight 50.
- **DC/VPN block** (`DC_VPN_BLOCK_ENABLED`) — heavier `datacenter-vpn` (weight 30) layered
  on existing `asn-hosting` (weight 5).
- **Per-endpoint policy engine** (`ENDPOINT_POLICIES` JSON) — fnmatch globs with 4 policies:
  `bypass` / `challenge` / `strict` / `default`. Extends `JS_CHAL_OPEN_PATHS`.
- 12 new hot-reloadable knobs (67 total). 6 new `RISK_WEIGHTS` entries.
- Empty admin-key file treated as missing (zero-byte `.admin_key` no longer silently accepted
  as valid credential).

### Tests
- 8 new tests for Tier A.

---

## [1.5.5] — Turnkey deployment + bundled GeoLite2 + hot-reload persistence

### Added
- `docker-compose.yml` + `.env.example` — `cp .env.example .env && edit && docker compose up -d`.
- **Bundled GeoLite2 mmdbs** baked into image at `/usr/local/share/maxmind/`; seeded into
  `/data` on first boot — GeoMap works offline out-of-the-box.
- **Auto-fetch GeoLite2** when `MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY` set — downloads both
  `GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb` + `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`; auto-refresh every 30 days.
- **`config_kv` SQLite table** — every hot-reload knob change persists across restarts. Env
  vars win over DB for GitOps determinism; env-pinned mutations rejected at runtime.
- **14 new promoted knobs** in `_HOT_RELOAD_KNOBS` (JS_CHALLENGE_TTL, ENUM_THRESHOLD,
  HOSTILE_BAN_SECS, TIMELINE_RETAIN_SECS, SVC_DB_RETENTION_HOURS, COST_RETAIN_SECS,
  LOG_FORMAT, POW_REQUIRED_PATHS, ALLOWED_METHODS, ALLOWED_HOSTS, MAX_IDENTITIES,
  PRUNE_IDLE_SECS, UPSTREAM_MAX_BODY, UPSTREAM_MAX_RESP).
- 30-day retention for `events`, `timeline`, `svc_metrics` (was 24 h / 7 d).
- **Chart click drill-downs** on main dashboard and agents detection-vs-miss timeline.
- **GeoMap "Fix now" button** → `/__maxmind-fetch` admin endpoint (seed + auto-fetch +
  reopen readers, no restart).
- **Risk-gated Turnstile** (`TURNSTILE_RISK_THRESHOLD`) — most legitimate users never see
  Turnstile; only suspected bots do.
- **Defense-thresholds slider** on main dashboard with numeric readouts.
- **Anubis as proper integration** in `/__external` (with toggle).
- `Permissions-Policy` opts out of Privacy Sandbox (silences Cloudflare-edge warnings on
  `*.trycloudflare.com`).
- `TURNSTILE_ENABLED` defaults to `0` even when Turnstile keys are present — prevents
  accidental gate activation with public test keys.

### Tests
- 21 unit + 14 functional + 148 regression = **183/183 passing**.
- **Bandit**: 0 High / 0 Critical · 11 Mediums (all confirmed FP).
- **Trivy**: 0 CVEs. SBOM: `sbom/sbom-1.5.5.cdx.json`.

---

## [1.5.4] — Dashboard UX overhaul + GeoMap + external-intel cards + pentest fixes

### Added
- **Defense thresholds slider** on main dashboard — drag soft (orange) and ban (red) markers
  along 0–200 track; live POST to `/__config`.
- **Orange "missed" line** on the timeline.
- **Cost-per-request graph** (`/__cost-timeline`) — outer middleware times every request;
  dashboard graphs avg/max ms per bucket.
- **Reason drill-down** — click any block reason → modal lists offending identities + IPs.
- **Identity & risk popovers** on agents and main Clients table.
- **Agents threshold widget** — up/down arrows + 0–100 range slider.
- **Anubis-mode** toggle in Controls (`ANUBIS_ENABLED`, `ANUBIS_DIFFICULTY_BOOST`).
- **GeoMap dashboard** (`/__geo`) — Leaflet world-map, CARTO Dark Matter tiles, time-window
  controls, green/orange/red circles.
- **Services panel + per-detector hits** in `/__metrics`.
- **External-integration cards** click-to-modal with vendor / docs / trigger / weight /
  data-egress / live telemetry.
- **MaxMind GeoLite2-City** support (`MAXMIND_CITY_DB_PATH`).
- **Bot-trap field variants** — multiple decoy fields, per-process random suffixes.
- **Mirrored upstream 404** for blocked admin-endpoint probes.
- **Admin-IP description** PATCH endpoint + click-to-edit cell in Controls.
- `JS_CHAL_BIND_JA4` / `JS_CHAL_REQUIRE_JA4` / `JS_CHAL_STRICT_STATIC` knobs.
- 11 new per-detector kill-switches in `/__config`.
- `CrowdSec` env-var alias: accepts both `CROWDSEC_API_KEY` and `CROWDSEC_LAPI_KEY`.
- `last_seen` units in Clients table progressive (s → min → h → d).

### Fixed
- **TRUSTED_PROXIES** (`X-Forwarded-For` honoured only when peer IP is in configured CIDRs)
  — closed pentest finding: any direct client could spoof XFF and impersonate any source IP.
- CrowdSec response hardening — non-list LAPI responses no longer crash the lookup.
- Epoch / monotonic mix-up causing DB-loaded clients to show negative ages.

### Tests
- **Bandit**: 0 High / 0 Critical. **Trivy**: 0 CVEs. SBOM: `sbom/sbom-1.5.4.cdx.json`.

---

## [1.5.3] — External intel + soft-challenge tier + hybrid identity

### Added
- **Hybrid identity** (cookie + fingerprint) for shared-NAT environments.
- **Soft-challenge tier** — `risk_score` in 4–8 band forces cookie challenge even on open
  paths.
- **AbuseIPDB** integration (crowdsourced IP reputation, 6 h SQLite cache; +50 high /
  +20 med).
- **CrowdSec LAPI** integration (self-hosted blocklist, 60 s cache; +70 instant ban).
- **MaxMind GeoLite2-ASN** tagging (`asn-hosting` signal, soft weight).
- `signals[]` array in event log.
- UA ↔ `Sec-Ch-Ua` consistency detector; `Accept: */*` HTML heuristic; JA4-required-missing
  soft penalty.
- **Defenses & scoring** merged table in Controls.
- **`admin_ips`** SQLite table for persistent allowlist.
- **Suspicious-path regex** — flag/secret/passwd/credentials/`*.bak`/`*.swp`/`.git/`/path
  traversal / SQLi / XSS / LFI markers.
- **Upstream-404 risk** tracking.

---

## [1.5.2] — Stealth-score auto-ban (WIP) + uniform topnav

### Added
- Hard stealth-score auto-ban knob (work-in-progress, not yet finalised).
- Uniform top-nav across every dashboard (`Dashboard / Agents / Service / Controls`,
  server-rendered `<a>` tags, visible without JS).

### Fixed
- Service dashboard crash when legacy nav-link IDs absent.

---

## [1.5.1] — Controls dashboard + throughput cap + inline unban

### Added
- **Controls dashboard** (`/__controls`) — on/off switch per toggleable control, number
  inputs for thresholds, textareas for lists, dirty-marker, Apply / Reset, audit log of
  `config_changed` events, banned-identity table with 1-click unban.
- **Global RPS cap** (`GLOBAL_RPS_LIMIT`) — live req/s card + operator slider; over-limit
  traffic silent-decoyed as `traffic-threshold`.
- **Inline Unban** button in Clients table. `/__ban` admin endpoint.

---

## [1.5.0] — Multi-instance fleet + session-churn detector + webhooks

### Added
- **Multi-instance shared state** (optional `REDIS_URL`) — bans propagate across N gateways;
  JA4 deny-list auto-syncs every 30 s.
- **Session-churn detector** — same `(UA + IP-tier + JA4)` minting > N chal cookies in a
  window enters the 24 h hostile pool (`session-churn`, weight 75).
- **Webhook fan-out** (`WEBHOOK_URL` + `WEBHOOK_SECRET` HMAC) on every ban; deduplicated
  via Redis `SETNX`.
- **Auto-add-to-JA4_DENY_LIST** after `JA4_AUTODENY_THRESHOLD` (default 3) bans on the
  same fingerprint.

---

## [1.4.7] — Hot-reload admin endpoint

### Added
- `GET/POST /__config` — read or update a whitelisted set of runtime knobs without restart.
  Every change audited as `event=config_changed`.

---

## [1.4.6] — Structured JSON logs + request correlation IDs

### Added
- `LOG_FORMAT=json` — one JSON document per line, ready for Loki / Splunk / CloudWatch.
- Short `r…` request ID minted at the top of `protect()`, threaded through every decision,
  stamped on response as `X-Request-ID`. Inbound `X-Request-ID` honoured (CDN trace
  propagation).

---

## [1.4.5] — HMAC key rotation

### Added
- `POST /__rotate-keys?key=…&scope=session|pow|all` — regenerates `SESSION_KEY` /
  `POW_HMAC_KEY` atomically, persists to `/data`. Every chal/session cookie issued before
  the call fails immediately.

### Fixed
- Closed pentest finding: old chal cookie remained valid after upgrade (HMAC secret not
  rotated).

---

## [1.4.4] — Turnstile-independent operation + status-mirror silent decoy

### Added
- Cookie gate works **without** Turnstile — auto-minted on first qualifying HTML GET
  (heuristic mode) when no Turnstile keys configured.
- Silent-decoy status code now mirrors upstream `/` instead of hard-coded 200 — closes the
  200-with-404-page fingerprint.

---

## [1.4.3] — AI canary-echo detection (R7) + 24 h hostile pool (R8)

### Added
- **Canary-echo detection** (`CANARY_ECHO_DETECTION=1`, default on) — every HTML response
  stamped with a unique `agw-c-<16hex>` token. Any identity that quotes it back is
  silent-decoyed and added to the hostile pool for `HOSTILE_BAN_SECS` (default 24 h).
  Near-zero FP on browser traffic; specifically catches LLM-driven agents.
- **Hostile pool** — 24 h ban duration for AI-agent-flagged reasons (canary-echo, honeypot,
  ai-probe, suspicious-path).

---

## [1.4.2] — Turnstile-only cookie gate

### Changed
- PoW + browser-API probe + anchor-fetch proof + timing window removed (all bypassable in
  Python in ~1 s). Cookie gate now requires Cloudflare Turnstile keys to engage.
- Chal cookie bound to (UA + IP-tier-hash + JA4-hash).

---

## [1.4.1] — Cookie gate hardening + service-metrics dashboard + JA4 binding

### Added
- Cookie required on every non-static path (closes V8: API-only paths slipped through).
